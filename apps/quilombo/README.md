## Data Fetching and State Management

This app uses a very opinionated approach to data fetching and state management:

- records that are the result of react-query fetches are sent from the server to hydrate the QueryClient
- The records are available for SSR in the page to have initial content to render AS WELL AS via react hooks without the need for additional API calls
- This is achieved by pre-populating the queries (as mentioned above) and using Jotai atoms that use the queries to fetch their state.
- This way, any client component that requires the record accesses atoms which result in a query for which the result is already available client-side
- Updates to a record via react-query update the query cache accordingly, so that the atoms always automatically represent the latest cached server state until the queries go stale.
