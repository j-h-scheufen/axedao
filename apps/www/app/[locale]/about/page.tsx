        <b>Capoeira</b> is one of the most fascinating microcosms and
        subcultures on this planet. With its origins in African culture and a
        history going back hundreds of years, Capoeira emerged as a reaction
        within Brazil&apos;s slavery system, survived in the jungle, and then
        took root in cities after slavery ended. It was outlawed to practice
        until 1936, when Mestre Bimba convinced the government to recongnize its
        cultural significance and allow the establishment of Capoeira sports
        academies. <br />
        Since the 1980s it has spread from Brazil all over the world creating a
        network of groups practicing its movements in different, evolving
        styles, its music and songs, with social networks and real world
        gatherings.
        <br />A whole economy involves events, courses, merchandize (clothes,
        instruments, multi-media) which supports those who dedicate their lives
        to Capoeira through teaching or other contributions that keep the
        culture alive and share in the joy it creates.
      </TextSection>
      <TextSection>
        And here&apos;s the point: The people keeping Capoeira alive are
        historically underpaid and underfunded and (for the most part) only make
        ends meet.
        <br />
        When it comes to &quot;digital&quot;, everyone is on their own
        leveraging freely available tools: social networks, YouTube,
        Amazon/Ebay, group management in Excel, payments? what payments?

        The term or concept of &quot;Axé&quot; &quot;appears simultaneously in
        Candomblé theology, Afro-Brazilian religious practices, and popular
        music&quot;
        (https://escholarship.org/content/qt9fz812sw/qt9fz812sw_noSplash_356e502eeb847ab88740b2c5f8b2202f.pdf).
        In Capoeira it losely has the meaning of &quot;good energy&quot; that
        can manifest in different ways, but usually when people get together to
        contribute and share into the same experience, e.g. when making music
        together. It is usually associated with the feeling of anticipation,
        heightened energy, and excitement you feel in the roda: The more the
        players, musicians, and participants in the roda feed off of each
        other&apos;s energy, the more Axé.
        <br />
        &quot;Axé é um conceito que pode ser definido como força invisível...axé
        é força vital, energia, a grande força inerente a todas as coisas... axé
        é a força contida em todos os elementos naturais e seres, porém que
        necessita de certos rituais e da palavra falada para ser detonado ou
        dinamizado&quot; REF

        An important thing about Capoeira is the mindset which is rooted in
        Liberation (https://www.amazon.com/-/en/J-Lowell-Lewis/dp/0226476839)
        and some Street-Smartness
        (https://www.amazon.com/Street-Smart-Song-Capoeira-Philosophy-Inner/dp/158394155X/ref=sr_1_1)
        sprinkled in later. A culture steeped in defiance and resistance matches
        well with the crypto&quot;s origins and ethos: digital & economic
        autonomy.

        AXÉ DAO exists to build digital community infrastructure for Capeira by
        using a decentralized organization to coordinate (otherwise this would
        never happen).
