# Capoeira Umbrella Organizations: Federations, Confederations, and Meta-Organizations

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Purpose**: Document umbrella organizations in capoeira that are NOT individual schools/groups but rather meta-organizations representing multiple groups, organizing competitions, and providing services to the capoeira community.

---

## IMPORTANT CONTEXT

This document focuses on **umbrella organizations** - artificial organizational structures that sit ABOVE individual capoeira schools and groups. These are distinct from traditional capoeira groups (like Senzala, ABADÁ, Capoeira Brasil, etc.) which teach capoeira directly to students.

**Umbrella organizations typically**:
- Represent multiple independent capoeira groups/schools
- Organize championships, competitions, tournaments
- Set standards for competitive/sport capoeira
- Provide certification, ranking systems, or recognition
- Advocate for capoeira at governmental/international levels
- Do NOT directly teach capoeira (though member groups do)

**Impact on Genealogy Research**:
- Currently have LITTLE direct impact on lineage/genealogy trees
- Individual practitioners still belong to specific groups (Senzala, ABADÁ, etc.)
- Lineage flows through mestre-student relationships, not federation memberships
- However, federations may:
  - Provide standardization that affects how groups operate
  - Facilitate connections between groups
  - Offer competitive platforms where different lineages interact
  - Influence legitimacy and recognition in some regions

**Controversial Nature**:
Many traditional capoeira mestres and groups resist affiliation with governing bodies, preferring autonomy and traditional structures. Umbrella organizations remain contentious in the capoeira community.

  },

  urls: {
    website?: string,
    facebook?: string,
    instagram?: string
  }
}
```

### Relationships: Umbrella Organizations ← → Groups/Persons

```typescript
umbrella_organization_memberships {
  id: uuid,
  umbrella_org_id: uuid,

  member_type: 'group' | 'person' | 'national_federation' | 'local_chapter',
  member_id: uuid,                           // Group or Person

  role?: string,                             // 'Vice-President', 'Board Member', etc.

  services_received: string[],               // What member gets from org
  obligations: string[]                      // What member owes to org
}
```

### National Federations as Separate Entities

```typescript
national_capoeira_federations {
  id: uuid,
  country: string,
  name: string,

  founded_year: number,
  government_recognition: boolean,
  recognizing_body?: string,                 // 'Russian Ministry of Sport'

  umbrella_org_membership: [{
    umbrella_org_id: uuid,                   // e.g., WCF
    membership_type: string,                 // 'full_member'
    since_date: Date
  }],

  affiliated_groups: uuid[],                 // Groups that are members
  estimated_schools: number,
  estimated_practitioners: number,

  activities: string[]
}
```

### Impact on Genealogy Tree

**Limited Direct Impact**:
- Umbrella organizations do NOT create lineage chains
- Mestre-student relationships flow through groups, not federations
- Example: Capoeirista trains under Mestre X (Senzala) → Lineage is Senzala, NOT WCF (even if Senzala affiliated with WCF)

**Indirect Impacts to Track**:

1. **Standardization Influence**:
   ```typescript
   groups {
     affected_by_standardization: boolean,
     adopts_wcf_standards: boolean,
     participates_in_championships: boolean
   }
   ```

2. **Recognition and Legitimacy**:
   ```typescript
   persons {
     umbrella_org_rankings: [{
       org_id: uuid,
       rank: string,
       points: number,
       year: number
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Facilitated Connections**:
   - Championships bring different lineages together
   - May affect cross-group training, guest instructors, etc.
   - Track as events/interactions, not lineage

4. **Regional Variation**:
   - Russia: Strong federation structure (Russian Federation, WCF member)
   - Brazil: Resistance to federation (autonomy preferred)
   - USA: Mix (ICAF cultural network popular, WCF less so)
   - Track as cultural context per country

**DO NOT Confuse**:
- ❌ Being member of WCF does NOT make you "WCF lineage"
- ✅ You are still lineage of your mestre/group
- Umbrella org membership is administrative/competitive, NOT pedagogical

---

## Community Attitudes Toward Umbrella Organizations

### Traditional Resistance (Majority View)

**Many traditional capoeira mestres and groups resist umbrella organizations**:

**Reasons for Resistance**:
1. **Autonomy**: Capoeira historically decentralized; each mestre leads independently
2. **Commercialization Fear**: Federations seen as attempt to profit from cultural tradition
3. **Bureaucratization**: Rules, standards, rankings seen as contrary to capoeira's fluid nature
4. **Cultural Appropriation**: Sport focus may strip capoeira of cultural/spiritual dimensions
5. **Colonial Parallels**: External authority imposing structure on Afro-Brazilian art form
6. **Olympic Debate**: Many believe capoeira should NOT be Olympic sport (loses cultural essence)

**Examples of Resistance**:
- Established 1992, Brazilian Confederation faced immediate resistance; many groups refused to join
- Traditional Angola groups (Ngoma, Angoleiros do Sertão, etc.) typically do NOT affiliate with sport federations
- Even large contemporânea groups (Senzala, ABADÁ) largely maintain independence from federations

### Support (Minority but Growing View)

**Some groups and practitioners support umbrella organizations**:

**Reasons for Support**:
1. **Legitimacy**: Government recognition helps capoeira gain status as legitimate martial art/sport
2. **Funding**: Official sport status can bring government funding for programs
3. **Standardization**: Competitive capoeiristas want clear rules and ranking systems
4. **Olympic Dream**: Some believe Olympic inclusion would elevate capoeira globally
5. **Networking**: Federations facilitate connections between groups and countries
6. **Professionalization**: Career paths for professional capoeira athletes

**Examples of Support**:
- Russian Capoeira Federation members (Só Força and others) - 350+ participants in championships
- WCF member national federations
- Competitive sport-oriented capoeiristas

### Middle Ground (FICA/ICAF Model)

**FICA/ICAF represents compromise**:
- Network/foundation rather than competitive federation
- Cultural preservation focus (no championships)
- Autonomy maintained (local chapters independent non-profits)
- Collaboration without bureaucracy
- Angola tradition respected

**This model appears more widely accepted** because:
- No attempt to standardize or control
- No sport/competition focus
- Respects traditional structures
- Provides benefits (connection, resources) without imposing authority

---

## Current State and Future Outlook

### Current Landscape (2025)

**Fragmented**:
- Multiple competing umbrella organizations (WCF, ICAF, national federations, etc.)
- No single recognized global authority
- Most capoeira groups remain independent
- Regional variation (Russia more federated, Brazil more independent)

**Limited Influence**:
- Umbrella organizations serve minority of capoeira community
- Traditional mestre-student lineages remain dominant
- Genealogy flows through groups, not federations

**Growing Sport Capoeira**:
- WCF gaining traction in some countries
- Younger generation more open to competition
- National federations forming (Sweden, Russia, etc.)

### Future Possibilities

**Scenario 1: Olympic Inclusion**
- If capoeira becomes Olympic sport, WCF influence would grow dramatically
- Would likely create split: Traditional vs. Sport capoeira (parallel to Taekwondo)
- Genealogy research would need to track both branches

**Scenario 2: Continued Fragmentation**
- Multiple organizations coexist without clear leader
- Most groups remain independent
- Umbrella orgs remain niche (sport competitors, specific regions)

**Scenario 3: Cultural Preservation Dominance**
- ICAF model expands globally
- Network approach preferred over hierarchical federation
- Cultural focus prevents sportification

**Scenario 4: Regional Divergence**
- Some regions (Russia, Europe) adopt federation structures
- Others (Brazil, USA traditional groups) resist
- No global standard; regional variation increases

### Questions for Continued Research

1. **How many national federations exist worldwide?**
   - WCF structure suggests one per country, but which countries actually have them?

2. **What is the total membership of WCF?**
   - Number of national federations, individuals, groups?

3. **What is the relationship between WCF and traditional capoeira groups?**
   - Do any major groups (Senzala, ABADÁ, CB, etc.) affiliate with WCF?
   - Or is WCF primarily independent practitioners and smaller groups?

4. **What other umbrella organizations exist?**
   - Are there regional confederations (European, African, Asian)?
   - Are there style-specific federations (Angola-only, Regional-only)?

5. **How do umbrella orgs affect mestre recognition?**
   - WCF has "Council of Masters" - do they recognize mestres independently of traditional lineages?
   - Does WCF recognition conflict with traditional mestre graduations?

6. **What is the financial model of these organizations?**
   - Membership fees, championship entry fees, government funding?
   - How sustainable are they?

7. **What is the actual influence on teaching and practice?**
   - Do WCF standards affect how affiliated groups teach?
   - Or is federation membership purely administrative?

---

## Summary: Relevance to Genealogy Tree Project

### Current Impact: MINIMAL

Umbrella organizations currently have **minimal direct impact on capoeira genealogy research** because:

1. **Lineage flows through mestre-student relationships**, not federation memberships
2. **Most groups remain independent** of umbrella organizations
3. **Traditional structures dominate**: Senzala, ABADÁ, CB, Ngoma, etc. operate autonomously
4. **Federation membership is administrative**, not pedagogical

### Data Model Considerations: TRACK BUT DON'T PRIORITIZE

**Include in database**:
- `umbrella_organizations` table
- `umbrella_organization_memberships` relationship table
- `national_capoeira_federations` table

**Track**:
- Which groups/persons affiliate with which umbrella orgs
- Championship participation and rankings
- Regional federation structures

**DO NOT**:
- Treat federation membership as lineage
- Prioritize umbrella org data over mestre-student relationships
- Assume federation recognition = capoeira legitimacy

### Future Monitoring

**IF capoeira becomes Olympic sport**, umbrella organizations (especially WCF) will become MUCH more important:
- May create parallel "Sport Capoeira" vs. "Traditional Capoeira" split
- Would require tracking two genealogy trees
- Would affect how future generations train and progress

**For now**: Document umbrella organizations as context, but focus genealogy research on traditional mestre-student lineages through groups like Senzala, ABADÁ, Ngoma, CB, Angoleiros, GCAP, ICAF chapters, and independent mestres.
