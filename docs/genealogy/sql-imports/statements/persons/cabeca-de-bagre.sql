--
-- Cabeça de Bagre is known only from a single newspaper reference
-- (Jornal Metropolitano, 1960) which listed him among outstanding
-- capoeiristas of Salvador's Liberdade neighborhood alongside
-- Bimba, Waldemar, Traíra, and Espinho Remoso.
--
-- This listing does NOT justify `associated_with` statements because:
-- - Being listed together as contemporaries in an article is not
--   a specific documented connection between individuals
-- - There is no evidence of direct interaction, collaboration,
--   rivalry, or other specific relationship
--
-- The contemporaries are documented in:
-- - bio_en/bio_pt columns (narrative context)
-- - notes_en/notes_pt columns (structured CONTEMPORARIES section)
-- - The .md report Connections table (for human readers)
--
-- No teacher-student relationships can be established due to
-- complete lack of documentation about Cabeça de Bagre's
-- training history, teachers, or students.
