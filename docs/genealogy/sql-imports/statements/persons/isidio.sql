-- ============================================================
-- Contains all relationships where Isídio is the SUBJECT.
--
-- NOTE: There are no confirmed relationships where Isídio is the subject.
-- The only documented connection is that Cobrinha Verde obtained patuá
-- materials FROM Isídio, meaning Cobrinha Verde is the subject of that
-- relationship. That statement belongs in cobrinha-verde.sql.
-- ============================================================

-- NO STATEMENTS TO GENERATE
--
-- Isídio's role was passive/recipient: he provided materials to Cobrinha Verde.
-- The relationship direction is: Cobrinha Verde → obtained_materials_from → Isídio
-- However, "obtained_materials_from" is not a valid predicate in our schema.
--
-- The most appropriate modeling is:
-- - Isídio associated_with Tio Pascoal (if they were fellow practitioners)
-- - However, this is speculative - we only know Pascoal knew of Isídio
--
-- Given the uncertainty, no statements are generated for Isídio.
-- His existence is documented but relationships are uncertain.

-- ============================================================
-- Isídio associated_with Tio Pascoal - SPECULATIVE: Pascoal knew how to
--   direct Cobrinha Verde to Isídio, suggesting a connection, but the
--   nature of this connection is unknown. Could be: teacher-student,
--   fellow practitioners, members of same religious brotherhood, or
--   simply acquaintances within the mandingueiro network.
--   NOT GENERATING due to insufficient evidence.
