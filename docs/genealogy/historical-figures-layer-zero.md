# Historical Figures: Layer Zero

**Purpose:** Document the foundational layer of capoeira genealogy - mythological figures, African royalty, resistance leaders, and proto-mestres who predate the documented lineages of Mestre Bimba and Mestre Pastinha.

**Date:** 2025-12-08

---

## Overview

This document catalogs "Layer Zero" - the historical and mythological figures who form the cultural and spiritual foundation of capoeira before the modern era (pre-1930s). These figures fall into several categories:

1. **African Royalty & Resistance Leaders** - Figures who inspire capoeira philosophy and group names
2. **Quilombo Leaders** - Leaders of escaped slave communities where proto-capoeira may have developed
3. **Proto-Mestres** - The generation that taught Bimba, Pastinha, and their contemporaries
4. **Legendary Capoeiristas** - Semi-mythical figures like Besouro Mangangá

---

## Category 1: African Royalty & Resistance Leaders

These figures didn't practice capoeira but are foundational to its cultural identity and inspire group names.

### Queen Nzinga Mbandi Ngola (1581-1663)

**Significance:** The origin of the "ginga" - the fundamental movement in capoeira.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Nzinga Mbandi Ngola |
| Also Known As | Rainha Ginga, Queen Njinga, Ana de Sousa |
| Born | 1581, Ndongo (present-day Angola) |
| Died | December 17, 1663, Matamba |
| Role | Queen of Ndongo (1624-1663) and Matamba (1631-1663) |

**Biography:**
Queen Nzinga was a paramount ruler of the Ambundu Kingdoms in present-day northern Angola. Known as "Rainha Ginga," she led a 40-year resistance against Portuguese colonial occupation and the slave trade. She received military and political training as a child and demonstrated exceptional diplomatic skills. She formed alliances with Imbangala warriors and personally led troops into battle using guerrilla warfare tactics.

**Connection to Capoeira:**
- The term "ginga" (the fundamental swaying movement of capoeira) derives from her name
- Her tactics of mobility, evasion, and resistance mirror capoeira philosophy
- She influenced Zumbi's resistance, contributing to the establishment of quilombos in Brazil
- Multiple capoeira groups bear her name, notably **Grupo Nzinga de Capoeira Angola** (founded by Mestra Janja, Mestra Paulinha, and Mestre Poloca)

**Profile Type:** `inspirational_figure` (not a capoeirista, but culturally foundational)

### The Mandinka People (Cultural Influence)

**Significance:** Origin of the term "mandinga" - the cunning, mystical quality in capoeira.

**Background:**
The Mandinka (also Mandingo, Mandinga) are a West African ethnic group primarily from Mali, The Gambia, Senegal, and Guinea, numbering about 15 million. They are descendants of the Mali Empire, founded by Sundiata Keita in 1235.

**Connection to Capoeira:**
During the trans-Atlantic slave trade, many Mandinka were brought to Brazil. In colonial Brazil, the word "Mandinga" evolved to mean:
- A fetish or magical object capable of causing good or evil
- A charm worn to protect the body
- Sorcery or witchcraft
- In capoeira: cunning, deception, and almost magical fighting ability

The term "mandingueiro" in capoeira refers to a player who embodies cunning and mystical qualities, able to outsmart opponents through guile and seeming supernatural ability.

## Category 2: Quilombo Leaders

Leaders of escaped slave communities (quilombos) where resistance fighting techniques may have developed into capoeira.

### Princess Aqualtune (fl. 1665-1675)

| Died | ~1675 (mysterious death) |
| Role | Princess of Kongo, Military Leader, Quilombo Leader |

**Biography:**
Aqualtune was a Kongo princess, daughter of an unidentified Manikongo (King of Kongo). In 1665, she led 10,000 men into the Battle of Mbwila against Portugal. After King Antonio I was killed and her forces defeated (approximately 5,000 men died), she was captured and transported to Brazil as a slave. She was purchased as a "breeding slave" at Porto Calvo mill. She escaped and reached Palmares, becoming leader of the Subupuira quilombo.

**Family:**
- Mother of Ganga Zumba (first king of Palmares)
- Mother of Gana Zona
- Mother of Sabina (mother of Zumbi)
- Grandmother of Zumbi dos Palmares

**Profile Type:** `resistance_leader`

### Ganga Zumba (c. 1630-1678)

**Significance:** First king of Quilombo dos Palmares, title meaning "priest of the spiritual defense of the community."

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Nganga Nzumba (title, not proper name) |
| Born | c. 1630 |
| Died | 1678 (poisoned) |
| Birth Place | Kingdom of Kongo (enslaved to Brazil) |
| Death Place | Cucaú Valley, Brazil |
| Role | First King of Quilombo dos Palmares |

**Biography:**
Ganga Zumba was the son of Princess Aqualtune. He was enslaved at the Santa Rita plantation in Pernambuco along with his brother Zona and sister Sabina. They escaped to Palmares. He rose to lead the confederation of ten mocambos (settlements) that formed Quilombo dos Palmares. By the 1670s, he had a palace at his royal compound Macaco with 1,500 houses, three wives, guards, ministers, and devoted subjects.

In Kikongo, "nganga a nzumbi" means "the priest responsible for the spiritual defense of the community" - indicating his role was as much spiritual as political.

In 1678, after devastating attacks, he accepted a peace treaty with the Portuguese. His nephew Zumbi opposed this treaty and led a revolt. Ganga Zumba was poisoned, likely by a relative, for making peace with the colonizers.

### Zumbi dos Palmares (1655-1695)

**Significance:** Greatest symbol of resistance in Brazilian history; capoeira's most celebrated historical icon.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Zumbi dos Palmares |
| Born | 1655, Palmares, Capitaincy of Pernambuco |
| Died | November 20, 1695 (killed in battle) |
| Role | Last King of Quilombo dos Palmares |

**Biography:**
Zumbi was the grandson of Princess Aqualtune and nephew of Ganga Zumba. Born free in Palmares, he was captured as an infant and given to a Portuguese priest who named him Francisco and taught him Portuguese and Latin. At age 15, he escaped back to Palmares. He became a military leader and strategist who organized and trained warriors.

When Ganga Zumba accepted a peace treaty with the Portuguese in 1678, Zumbi refused, believing it would lead to the re-enslavement of his people. He led a revolt, and Ganga Zumba was poisoned. Zumbi then led Palmares' resistance until 1694 when the quilombo was destroyed by a Portuguese expedition. He escaped but was betrayed and killed on November 20, 1695.

**Connection to Capoeira:**
While no direct historical evidence confirms Zumbi practiced capoeira as it's known today, the connection is deeply symbolic:
- Palmares is sometimes called "the birthplace of capoeira"
- The quilombo's military used Angolan combat techniques (sangha) and guerrilla tactics
- November 20 (day of his death) is Black Consciousness Day in Brazil
- His courageous spirit is said to "live on in capoeira"
- Many capoeira songs commemorate him

**Note:** Historical accounts describe Palmares warriors as armed with spears, bows, arrows, and guns - not capoeira. The association is more spiritual/symbolic than documented.

## Category 2b: Arrest Records & Documented Names (1789-1890)

The historical record of capoeira consists largely of arrest records, not lineages. Here are the documented names from police and judicial records.

### Adão (1789) - THE FIRST DOCUMENTED CAPOEIRISTA

**Significance:** The earliest known individual arrested for capoeira - the very first name in capoeira's documented history.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Plácido de Abreu Morais |
| Pseudonym | Pompeo Steel |
| Born | 1857, Portugal |

**Biography:**
Born in Portugal, Plácido immigrated to Brazil as a teenager in the 1870s. He was drawn into Rio's street culture and participated in capoeira rodas, being considered an "amateur capoeirista." His 1886 work "Os Capoeiras" remains one of the earliest and most detailed accounts of capoeira before criminalization.

**Note:** In 1886, Plácido rejected the oral tradition of African origins because "at that time a capoeira-like game was not known in Africa" - a claim now understood to be incorrect.

### Cyriaco / Francisco da Silva Cyríaco (early 20th century)

**Significance:** National hero who defeated Japanese jiu-jitsu fighter in 1909 - proved capoeira's effectiveness when it was still illegal.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Francisco da Silva Cyríaco |
| Apelido | Cyríaco, "Macaco Velho" (Old Monkey) |
| From | Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro |
| Famous For | Defeating Sada Miyako (jiu-jitsu), May 1, 1909 |

**The Historic Fight (May 1, 1909):**
At Concerto Avenida in Rio de Janeiro, Cyriaco faced Sada Miyako, a Japanese jiu-jitsu fighter considered invincible. This is considered perhaps the first professional Vale Tudo match in Brazilian history.

Miyako was immediately knocked down with a capoeira kick called "Rabo de Arraia" (Stingray's Tail). He got up but was hit again with the same kick and knocked out.

The magazine O Malho declared "the purely national game had the honors of victory and defeated the Japanese game." The newspaper A Notícia compared Cyriaco to Santos Dumont and called him a world champion.

Despite capoeira being prohibited, Cyriaco demonstrated his techniques twice at the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro. Miyako's reputation never recovered.

## Category 3: 19th Century Capoeiristas (Named Practitioners)

Named capoeiristas from the 1800s - the earliest documented practitioners outside of arrest records. Most were associated with the "capoeira carioca" tradition in Rio de Janeiro, which was largely destroyed after the 1890 criminalization.

### Major Miguel Nunes Vidigal (early 19th century)

**Significance:** Paradoxically, the chief persecutor of capoeiristas was himself a master - the earliest named capoeira practitioner in documented history.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Miguel Nunes Vidigal |
| Title | Major |
| Profession | Head of Royal Police Guard |
| Location | Rio de Janeiro |
| Active | 1808-1820s |

**Biography:**
In 1809, Prince Regent Dom João VI established the Royal Police Guard with Major Nunes Vidigal as its head. He was an implacable persecutor of candomblés, samba gatherings, and especially capoeiristas, "for whom he reserved a special treatment, a type of beatings and torture that he called 'Ceia dos Camarões'" (Shrimp Supper).

Ironically, Major Vidigal was himself an excellent capoeirista. He was described as "a tall, fat man, of a grenadier's caliber, slow, with a soft voice, but a skillful capoeira, with cold blood and agility beyond all proof, respected by the most fearsome thugs of his time. He played marvelously with the stick, knife, punch, and razor, and in head and foot blows he was unsurpassed."

His reputation gave rise to the phrase "lá vem o Vidigal" (here comes Vidigal), meaning something terrible was coming.

**Note:** Who taught Vidigal is unknown. He represents the earliest named individual with documented capoeira skills.

| Location | Rio de Janeiro |
| Era | Mid-19th century |

**Biography:**
Manduca da Praia was a tall man with a pointy beard and grey and copper-colored hair, always wearing his trademark white beaver hat and dressing elegantly. He earned a decent living from his fish counter on the market square and worked as a bodyguard for influential politicians.

He was agile and very acrobatic, capable of fighting multiple opponents barehanded but also expert with weapons: knife, razor blade, wooden stick (petropolis), and his "walking" cane which accompanied him at all times.

He responded to 27 legal proceedings for grievous bodily harm but always got off free thanks to his well-connected associates. His famous fight with Portuguese Deputy Santana made his name legendary.

| Born | 1842 |
| Died | 1936 (age ~94) |
| Location | Pernambuco |

**Biography:**
José Antonio do Nascimento was considered one of the best fighters of the nineteenth century. His unusually large size earned him the nickname "Nascimento Grande." He was believed to have "corpo fechado" - invincibility where even bullets could not hit him.

Despite being described as mild-mannered, he would humiliate opponents after defeating them, making many enemies. His legendary fight with João Sabe Tudo ("João knows everything") was so evenly matched it moved into a local church, where a vicar intervened to end it.

Despite a life of peril, he lived to approximately 90-94 years old.

**Spiritual Beliefs:** Believed to possess corpo fechado

After the revolt was quelled (30 killed, 110 wounded, 945 arrested), Prata Preta was captured in "terrible hand-to-hand combat," straight-jacketed, and imprisoned. He was summarily banished without due process to Acre, where he was abandoned without shelter or means of sustenance. Nothing is known of his fate after deportation.

## Category 3a: Proto-Mestres

The African-born generation that taught Bimba, Pastinha, and other founders of modern capoeira.

### Benedito (late 19th century)

**Significance:** African elder who taught Mestre Pastinha, making him the earliest traceable teacher in the Angola lineage.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Benedito |
| Origin | Angola, Africa |
| Active | Late 19th century, Salvador, Bahia |
| Role | Capoeira teacher |

**Biography:**
Benedito was an elderly African man, native of Angola, who lived in the Rua da Laranjeira neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia. Around 1899, he witnessed the young Vicente Ferreira (later Mestre Pastinha), then a frail ten-year-old, being bullied by a larger boy. Benedito offered to teach him capoeira to defend himself.

After several months of training, Pastinha successfully defeated his bully. He continued training with Benedito for two more years.

**Notable:**
- Benedito apparently did not use a berimbau, only a drum - common in Bahian capoeira at that time
- This represents the "African-born" generation teaching the "Brazilian-born" generation
- The direct Angola-to-Bahia transmission

**Biography:**
Daniel Coutinho was born in Salvador, Bahia, son of José Coutinho and Maria Conceição. He could read and write, which he considered himself educated for that time. At age 8 (1917), he began learning capoeira from Mestre Cândido Pequeno in Beco de Xaréu.

During the 1920s, Noronha, his brother Livino, and many other mestres founded the Centro de Capoeira Angola at Ladeira de Pedra (Gengibirra) in the Liberdade neighborhood. The center's colors were green and yellow (Brazilian flag colors).

Noronha and Mestre Livino also managed the "Centro de Capoeira Angola da Conceição da Praia."

In 1941, together with other mestres, they handed the Centro Nacional de Capoeira de Origem Angola to Mestre Pastinha after Amorzinho's death.

He worked various jobs: shoeshine boy, stevedore, dock worker, ragpicker, shipboard worker, truck driver assistant, street porter, and in the petrol industry.

In 1968, he participated in Jair Moura's film "Dança de Guerra." In 1976, he completed his manuscripts, published posthumously in 1993 as "O ABC da Capoeira Angola - Os Manuscritos do Mestre Noronha."

### Mestre Aberrê / Antonio Raimundo (early 20th century)

**Significance:** Bridge figure who invited Pastinha to Gengibirra, leading to Pastinha's role as leader of Capoeira Angola.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Antonio Raimundo |
| Apelido | Aberrê, Raimundo ABR |
| Location | Baixada do Matatu Preto, Matatu neighborhood, Salvador |
| Role | Mestre, Founding member of Gengibirra |

**Biography:**
Mestre Aberrê practiced capoeira in the baixada do Matatu Preto in Salvador. His capoeira origin traces to Mestre Antonio de Noronha (according to some accounts).

In 1941, Aberrê invited Mestre Pastinha to attend a Sunday roda at Ladeira de Gengibirra in the Liberdade neighborhood, where the best mestres gathered. Aberrê was already famous in these rodas. After spending the afternoon there, Mestre Amorzinho asked Pastinha to take charge of Capoeira Angola.

**Historical Debate:**
According to Mestre Caiçara (Antonio Carlos Moraes), Aberrê was not actually formed by Pastinha. Before Bimba and Pastinha formalized capoeira, it was learned in the streets; good practitioners became known as "mestres" by reputation. This appears to be how Aberrê earned his title.

- Mestre Caiçara

## Category 4: Legendary Capoeiristas

Semi-mythical figures whose stories blend history with folklore.

### Besouro Mangangá (1897-1924)

**Significance:** The most legendary capoeirista in history; his exploits are celebrated in countless songs and stories.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Manoel Henrique Pereira |
| Apelido | Besouro Mangangá, Besouro Cordão de Ouro |
| Born | 1897, Santo Amaro da Purificação, Bahia |
| Died | 1924, Santo Amaro da Purificação (stabbed with tucum wood knife) |
| Title | Mestre (by reputation) |
| Style | Pre-codification (Angola tradition) |

**Biography:**
Besouro Mangangá ("Beetle of the Golden Cord") was born in Santo Amaro da Purificação in the Recôncavo region of Bahia - an area with deep African cultural roots. His nickname "Besouro" (beetle) referenced his agility and the belief he could escape danger like a flying beetle.

He learned capoeira from Tio Alípio, an African ex-slave, when he was a boy. He became famous for his exceptional capoeira skills and for standing up against oppression during intense racial discrimination in post-slavery Brazil.

**Spiritual Beliefs - Corpo Fechado:**
Besouro was believed to have a "corpo fechado" (closed body) - spiritual protection making him invulnerable to bullets and blades. This protection came through:
- The practice of "mandinga" (magic/sorcery)
- Wearing a "patuá" (magical amulet)
- Allegedly taught to him by an African named Pasquale, neighbor of his grandmother
- The term "Mangangá" itself refers to a magical spell creating corpo fechado

**Death (Legend):**
According to legend, his enemies knew killing Besouro would be difficult due to his corpo fechado. They allegedly paid a prostitute to get him drunk, sleep with him, and steal his patuá. One of the men then stabbed him in the back with a blade made from tucum wood - said to have magical properties able to penetrate a "closed body."

**Legacy:**
- Subject of countless capoeira songs
- 2009 Brazilian film "Besouro"
- Taught Mestre Cobrinha Verde (his cousin)
- His students/influences include many foundational mestres

**Students:**
- Mestre Cobrinha Verde (cousin, started learning at age 4)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Full Name | Rafael Alves Franca |
| Apelido | Cobrinha Verde (Little Green Snake) |
| Born | 1908, Santo Amaro da Purificação, Bahia |
| Died | 1983 |
| Title | Mestre |
| Style | Angola |

**Biography:**
Rafael Alves Franca was born in Santo Amaro da Purificação - the same city as Besouro Mangangá, which he called "the birthplace of Bahian capoeira." He began learning capoeira from Besouro at age 4 in 1912. Besouro was his cousin and gave him the nickname "Cobrinha Verde" (little green snake) because he was very quick.

Beyond Besouro, he learned from many mestres in Santo Amaro: Maitá, Licurí, Joité, Dendê, Gasolina, Siri de Mangue, Doze Homens, Esperidião, Juvêncio Grosso, Espinho Remoso, and Neco Canário Pardo. Notably, Neco Canário Pardo taught him machete, while a woman named Tonha (Tonha Rolo do Mar) taught him razor technique.

He served as 3rd Sergeant in the old CR garrison in Campo Grande and participated in the Revolution of 1932. After leaving the army, he began teaching capoeira at Fazenda Garcia and at the Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola Dois de Julho in Amaralina.

**Spiritual Practices:**
His exploits were attributed to magical secrets taught by an African named Pasquale, neighbor of his grandmother. According to legend, he possessed a "patuá" with magical powers - an enchanted amulet said to jump when placed on an empty plate.

**Legacy:**
- Introduced to Capoeira Angola the practice of touching the floor repeatedly as if "releasing mandinga" - later spread by Mestre João Grande
- Taught alongside Mestre Pastinha
- Never charged money to teach capoeira (kept a promise to Besouro)
- Recorded album of capoeira songs with Mestre Traíra and Mestre Gato in 1963

## Notes for Database Import

### Profile Types

Consider adding a `profile_type` or `category` field to distinguish:
- `inspirational_figure` - Did not practice capoeira but culturally foundational
- `resistance_leader` - Historical resistance figure with symbolic connection
- `proto_mestre` - Pre-modern teacher (often African-born)
- `legendary_capoeirista` - Semi-mythical figure with documented impact
- `early_mestre` - First generation of documented mestres
- `mestre` - Standard documented mestre

### Handling Uncertainty

For Layer Zero figures, extensive use of:
- `confidence: 'uncertain'` or `'likely'`
- `date_precision: 'approximate'` or `'decade'`
- Detailed `notes` fields explaining sources and conflicts

### Symbolic vs. Documented Relationships

Some relationships are symbolic rather than documented training:
- Zumbi → capoeira connection is spiritual/cultural, not documented training
- Queen Nzinga → "ginga" etymology is meaningful but not a training relationship

Consider a predicate like `symbolically_connected_to` or use `influenced_by` with notes explaining the symbolic nature.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review and validate** this research with additional sources
2. **Generate SQL** for each figure following import-person.md template
3. **Determine relationship predicates** for symbolic connections
4. **Import Layer Zero** before importing modern mestres
5. **Connect Layer One** (Pastinha, Bimba) to their Layer Zero teachers
