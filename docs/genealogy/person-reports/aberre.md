**Biography:**
Mestre Aberrê practiced capoeira in the baixada do Matatu Preto in Salvador. His capoeira origin traces to Mestre Antonio de Noronha (according to some accounts).

In 1941, Aberrê invited Mestre Pastinha to attend a Sunday roda at Ladeira de Gengibirra in the Liberdade neighborhood, where the best mestres gathered. Aberrê was already famous in these rodas. After spending the afternoon there, Mestre Amorzinho asked Pastinha to take charge of Capoeira Angola.

**Historical Debate:**
According to Mestre Caiçara (Antonio Carlos Moraes), Aberrê was not actually formed by Pastinha. Before Bimba and Pastinha formalized capoeira, it was learned in the streets; good practitioners became known as "mestres" by reputation. This appears to be how Aberrê earned his title.
