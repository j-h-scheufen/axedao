**Biography:**
Israel Ozanam's paper is titled "Eu vou-me embora porque Apolônio da Capunga já anda na Boa Vista querendo prender gente" ("I'm leaving because Apolônio da Capunga is already in Boa Vista wanting to arrest people").

This suggests Apolônio was involved in policing/arresting capoeiristas in Boa Vista. However, he is also listed among the valentões who remained in Recife into the 1910s-1920s (documented in 1920).

**Historical Ambiguity:** Like Major Vidigal in Rio, Apolônio may have been both a persecutor AND practitioner of capoeira.
