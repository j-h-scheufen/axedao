**Biography:**
João Sabe Tudo was one of Nascimento Grande's most fierce adversaries and one of the most feared fighters of Recife. Despite their rivalry, they were friends who would throw parties together at the Hotel Sobrado Grande on Rua Camboa do Carmo in the Santo Antônio neighborhood.

He constantly challenged Nascimento Grande, calling him out for fights at specific times and places. Their legendary battle near the Largo da Paz bridge ended only when a parish priest intervened in the São José Church.
