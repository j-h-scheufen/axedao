**Biography:**
Like Jovino dos Coelhos, Adama handled the knife with surprising agility and was a specialist in one of capoeira's signature moves - the rasteira (leg sweep).

Oscar Mello, the crime reporter, says Adama loved Carnival. He was the director and founder of the Maracatu "Oriente Pequeno," which was respected by other carnival groups due to his fame as a valentão.

In 1907, he was involved in disturbances on a train returning from a religious festival, along with Eleutério and Formigão.

In 1908, the last year of "Oriente Pequeno," the group members entered into conflict with Maracatu "Centro Grande" and then with Club "Lenhadores."

**Note:** His illiteracy is documented in the "Livro de Entrada e Saída de Presos" (Book of Entry and Exit of Prisoners).
