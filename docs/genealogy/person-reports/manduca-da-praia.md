## Biography

Manduca da Praia was a tall man described as "pardo claro" (light-skinned mulatto), powerfully built with a graying pointed beard. He always dressed elegantly: white beaver hat, leather jacket, pocket watch with gold chain, polished shoes, and his trademark walking cane - which doubled as his weapon.

He earned a living from his fish counter in the São José parish marketplace, where he was known for holding court and sharing stories of his exploits. He supplemented this income with bodyguard work for politicians, building connections that would prove invaluable.

According to Plácido de Abreu's 1886 book "Os Capoeiras," Manduca was chief of the Santa Luzia party within the Nagoa federation - one of the two great rival factions that divided Rio de Janeiro (the Nagoas wore white; their rivals the Guaiamú wore red).

He started his career young at Lavadinho, making his name in the brutal sport of running with bulls. His weapons included the knife, razor blade, the "petrópolis" (a long hardwood cudgel), and his ever-present cane. His capoeira techniques were comprehensive: the banda and rasteira (sweeps), punches, headbutts, and the devastating rabo de arraia (stingray tail kick).

The fight that cemented his legend was against Portuguese Deputy Santana, known for his strength and skill with the stick. These street fights were vicious - no rules, ending only with knockout or submission. Manduca won decisively, and the two reportedly became friends afterward.

He faced 27 criminal charges for assault and grievous bodily harm. He was acquitted every single time thanks to his political connections. At the Penha festival, he once fought a group of armed pilgrims and left them all unconscious.

## Contemporaries

Among his contemporaries in Rio's capoeiragem were Mamede, Aleixo Açougueiro, Pedro Cobra, Bentevi, and Quebra Coco.
