**Biography:**
Born in Portugal, Plácido immigrated to Brazil as a teenager in the 1870s. He was drawn into Rio's street culture and participated in capoeira rodas, being considered an "amateur capoeirista." His 1886 work "Os Capoeiras" remains one of the earliest and most detailed accounts of capoeira before criminalization.

**Note:** In 1886, Plácido rejected the oral tradition of African origins because "at that time a capoeira-like game was not known in Africa" - a claim now understood to be incorrect.
