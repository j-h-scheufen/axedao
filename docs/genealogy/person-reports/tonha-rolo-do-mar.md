**Biography:**
Out of 296 female capoeira masters identified in Brazil and abroad, researchers identified Tonha Rolo do Mar as one of three possible pioneers. She taught Mestre Cobrinha Verde how to throw the razor on the cord, on his hands and feet, in Santo Amaro. She later moved to the neighborhood of Tomba in Feira de Santana, and there is no more news about her.

Her specialty was the military technique of playing with knife and razor tied to a cord.
