## The Mandinka People (Cultural Influence)

**Significance:** Origin of the term "mandinga" - the cunning, mystical quality in capoeira.

**Background:**
The Mandinka (also Mandingo, Mandinga) are a West African ethnic group primarily from Mali, The Gambia, Senegal, and Guinea, numbering about 15 million. They are descendants of the Mali Empire, founded by Sundiata Keita in 1235.

**Connection to Capoeira:**
During the trans-Atlantic slave trade, many Mandinka were brought to Brazil. In colonial Brazil, the word "Mandinga" evolved to mean:
- A fetish or magical object capable of causing good or evil
- A charm worn to protect the body
- Sorcery or witchcraft
- In capoeira: cunning, deception, and almost magical fighting ability

The term "mandingueiro" in capoeira refers to a player who embodies cunning and mystical qualities, able to outsmart opponents through guile and seeming supernatural ability.

## The Nagoa and Guaiamú (Malta Factions)

The two great rival capoeira factions that divided 19th-century Rio de Janeiro:

**Nagoa (Nagôas):**
- Wore white identification
- Associated with Santa Luzia party
- Chief: Manduca da Praia

**Guaiamú (Guaiamuns):**
- Wore red identification
- Associated with Saint Francis party
- Chief: Leandro Bonaparte

These maltas (gangs) were politically connected, providing muscle for politicians in exchange for protection from prosecution.

## The Quarto and Espanha Bands (Recife)

Two military bands that spawned rival capoeira factions in 19th-century Recife:

**Espanha Band:**
- National Guard Corps band
- Named for its Spanish conductor
- Associated faction: "Partido Espanha" or "Cabeças Secas"

**Quarto (4th) Band:**
- 4th Artillery Battalion band
- Departed for Paraguay War in 1865
- Associated faction: "Partido do 4º" or "Banha Cheirosa"

The capoeiristas who performed in front of these bands using ginga and kicks eventually transformed their movements into the "passo" - the foundational dance of frevo.
