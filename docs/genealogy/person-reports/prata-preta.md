**Biography:**
Prata Preta was a stevedore and capoeira practitioner who became one of the main leaders of the 1904 Vaccination Riot in Rio de Janeiro. He led protesters on the barricades of the Saúde neighborhood, using his capoeira skills to defend the "Porto Arthur" barricade.

After the revolt was quelled (30 killed, 110 wounded, 945 arrested), Prata Preta was captured in "terrible hand-to-hand combat," straight-jacketed, and imprisoned. He was summarily banished without due process to Acre, where he was abandoned without shelter or means of sustenance. Nothing is known of his fate after deportation.
