**Biography:**
Oscar Mello says Jovino dos Coelhos was one of the most notable valentões of this period. Protected by politicians, he committed "all sorts of horrors" in the city. The police had much work when he decided to cause disorder - it took **more than ten policemen to arrest him**.

He was an exemplary swimmer. When surrounded by police, he would escape by throwing himself into the waters of the Capibaribe River. He also handled a large pointed knife with skill.

Along with Nicolau do Poço, João de Totó, and Nascimento Grande, he was among the valentões whose names are preserved in Recife's carnival history.

He was one of the leaders of the capoeira maltas that protected the rival carnival bands in Recife. He was among the capoeiras who defended the bands of "Quarto" (4th Battalion) and "Espanha" (National Guard) during Pernambuco carnival with their agility, clubs, and knives.

**Death:** The newspaper Correio do Recife reported on his death on July 5, 1909, referring to him as a "bandido" (bandit). Items found in his pockets included notes to various individuals.
