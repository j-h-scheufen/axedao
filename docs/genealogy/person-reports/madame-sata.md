**Biography:**
Born into a family of ex-slaves with seventeen siblings, João Francisco dos Santos was reportedly traded for a mare as a child. He moved to Rio de Janeiro, settling in the Lapa neighborhood's bohemian underworld.

He was a skilled street fighter trained in capoeira, legendary for battling police. He routinely fought barehanded against quartets of policemen armed with wooden clubs. In one famous incident, a drunken João resisted arrest by a 24-man platoon, leaving seven agents badly wounded (two with broken arms, two with split livers).

His teacher was reportedly **Sete Coroas**, a famous malandro. Madame Satã represents the bridge between the old capoeira carioca of the malandros and the modern capoeira developing in the 1950s-60s.

He spent 27 years in prison, had 7 children, and published "Memórias de Madame Satã" in 1972. His life was portrayed in the 2002 film "Madame Satã."
