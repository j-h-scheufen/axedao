**Biography:**
Benedito was an elderly African man, native of Angola, who lived in the Rua da Laranjeira neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia. Around 1899, he witnessed the young Vicente Ferreira (later Mestre Pastinha), then a frail ten-year-old, being bullied by a larger boy. Benedito offered to teach him capoeira to defend himself.

After several months of training, Pastinha successfully defeated his bully. He continued training with Benedito for two more years.

**Notable:**
- Benedito apparently did not use a berimbau, only a drum - common in Bahian capoeira at that time
- This represents the "African-born" generation teaching the "Brazilian-born" generation
- The direct Angola-to-Bahia transmission
