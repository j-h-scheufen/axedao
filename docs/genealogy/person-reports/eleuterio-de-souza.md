**Biography:**
Eleutério de Souza was "one of the founders of the primitive stevedore work in Pernambuco." He was described as a "Homem valente" (valiant man) who "in his youth made an era in Recife."

He was "always preferred by old politicians," serving as a bodyguard, "especially during complicated elections."

In 1907, he was involved in disturbances on a train returning from a religious festival, along with Adama and Formigão.

**Note:** The stevedore/dock worker connection mirrors Bahia, where many capoeiristas worked at the port.
