Queen Nzinga was a paramount ruler of the Ambundu Kingdoms in present-day northern Angola. Known as "Rainha Ginga", she led a 40-year resistance against Portuguese colonial occupation and the slave trade. She received military and political training as a child and demonstrated exceptional diplomatic skills. She formed alliances with Imbangala warriors and personally led troops into battle using guerrilla warfare tactics.

**Connection to Capoeira:**
- The term "ginga" (the fundamental swaying movement of capoeira) derives from her name
- Her tactics of mobility, evasion, and resistance mirror capoeira philosophy
- She influenced Zumbi's resistance, contributing to the establishment of quilombos in Brazil
- Multiple capoeira groups bear her name, notably **Grupo Nzinga de Capoeira Angola** (founded by Mestra Janja, Mestra Paulinha, and Mestre Poloca)
