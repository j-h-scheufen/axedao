## Biography

Miguel Nunes Vidigal was born in Angra dos Reis in the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro. He enlisted young in a cavalry militia regiment and rose through the ranks: ensign (1782), lieutenant (1784), captain (1790), major (1797), lieutenant-colonel (1808), colonel (1808), honorary brigadier (1822), and brigadier (1824). He became the first Brazilian-born commander of military forces in the newly formed United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.

In 1809, one year after the arrival of Dom João VI, the Police Secretariat was created and the Royal Police Guard was organized, with Major Vidigal appointed as its chief. He was an implacable persecutor of candomblés, samba gatherings, and especially capoeiristas, "for whom he reserved a special treatment, a type of beatings and torture that he called 'Ceia dos Camarões'" (Shrimp Supper). The name derived from how victims' skin turned pink like cooked shrimp after the lashing sessions.

Ironically, Major Vidigal was himself an excellent capoeirista. He was described as "a tall, fat man, of a grenadier's caliber, slow, with a soft voice, but a skillful capoeira, with cold blood and agility beyond all proof, respected by the most fearsome thugs of his time. He played marvelously with the stick, knife, punch, and razor, and in head and foot blows he was unsurpassed."

His reputation gave rise to the phrase "lá vem o Vidigal" (here comes Vidigal), meaning something terrible was coming.

## The 1828 Mercenary Revolt - Capoeira's Turning Point

On June 9, 1828, German mercenary soldiers in Rio revolted after Major Francisco Pedro Drago ordered one of their comrades brutally lashed, then doubled the punishment to 200 sword strokes. The Germans freed their comrade and attacked the officer. About 200 Irish mercenaries joined. For three days, the foreign soldiers—armed, drunk, seizing weapons—controlled large portions of Rio, advancing toward the King's palace and burning officers' homes. The imperial forces were overwhelmed.

In this crisis, tradition holds that Vidigal called upon the very capoeiras he had persecuted. Slaveowners released their enslaved capoeiristas to form militias. An eyewitness recorded: "Many Germans in São Cristovão managed to assemble in one location. Those who didn't were confronted by a group of black capoeiras and engaged in deadly combat. Even when stationed and armed with rifles, the rebels couldn't withstand the fists, stones, and sticks. They fell in the streets and public squares, either wounded or dead."

Within three days the revolt was crushed. The toll: ~240 mercenaries killed, 300+ wounded; ~120 defenders killed, 180 wounded. Revolt leader August von Steinhousen was condemned to death. A German observer noted that the enslaved "gained five decades' worth of confidence in just three days." Historian Carlos Eugênio Líbano Soares argues this was the single most important event in establishing capoeira's dominance over Rio's streets for the rest of the 19th century.

After the mutiny, the Police Commissioner issued an edict prohibiting all blacks from carrying weapons—their very effectiveness had made them a greater threat.

## Legacy

He was immortalized as "Major Vidigal" in Manuel Antônio de Almeida's 1854 novel "Memórias de um Sargento de Milícias," which described him as "more than the chief—he was the owner of the colonial police... the horror of the unprotected classes of Rio de Janeiro."

In 1820, Benedictine monks granted him land at the foot of Morro Dois Irmãos. He died there on July 10, 1843, at age 98. The area is now known as the Vidigal neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro.

**Note:** Who taught Vidigal is unknown. He represents the earliest named individual with documented capoeira skills.
