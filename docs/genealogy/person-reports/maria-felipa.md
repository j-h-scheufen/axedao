**Biography:**
Maria Felipa de Oliveira was a freewoman, likely the daughter of an enslaved family of Sudanese descent. By oral tradition, she was a practitioner of capoeira. She led a group of 200 people, primarily women of Afro-Brazilian and indigenous descent (Tupinambás and Tapuias), in the Battle of Itaparica during Brazil's War of Independence (1822-1823).

Along with around 40 other women, she is said to have set fire to 42 boats belonging to the Portuguese Army at the Siege of Salvador. They used the peixeira (a knife from the fish trade) and stinging branches of cansanção (indigenous plants highly poisonous to the skin).

In July 2018, through Law 13.697/2018, her name was inscribed in the Livro dos Heróis e Heroínas da Pátria (Book of Heroes and Heroines of the Fatherland). A monument was erected in Salvador in 2023.

**Note:** While her role as a freedom fighter is well-documented, her training in capoeira is based on oral tradition and cannot be confirmed with primary sources.
