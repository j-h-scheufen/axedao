**Biography:**
Rafael Alves Franca was born in Santo Amaro da Purificação - the same city as Besouro Mangangá, which he called "the birthplace of Bahian capoeira." He began learning capoeira from Besouro at age 4 in 1912. Besouro was his cousin and gave him the nickname "Cobrinha Verde" (little green snake) because he was very quick.

Beyond Besouro, he learned from many mestres in Santo Amaro: Maitá, Licurí, Joité, Dendê, Gasolina, Siri de Mangue, Doze Homens, Esperidião, Juvêncio Grosso, Espinho Remoso, and Neco Canário Pardo. Notably, Neco Canário Pardo taught him machete, while a woman named Tonha (Tonha Rolo do Mar) taught him razor technique.

He served as 3rd Sergeant in the old CR garrison in Campo Grande and participated in the Revolution of 1932. After leaving the army, he began teaching capoeira at Fazenda Garcia and at the Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola Dois de Julho in Amaralina.

**Spiritual Practices:**
His exploits were attributed to magical secrets taught by an African named Pasquale, neighbor of his grandmother. According to legend, he possessed a "patuá" with magical powers - an enchanted amulet said to jump when placed on an empty plate.

**Legacy:**
- Introduced to Capoeira Angola the practice of touching the floor repeatedly as if "releasing mandinga" - later spread by Mestre João Grande
- Taught alongside Mestre Pastinha
- Never charged money to teach capoeira (kept a promise to Besouro)
- Recorded album of capoeira songs with Mestre Traíra and Mestre Gato in 1963
