**Biography:**
Ganga Zumba was the son of Princess Aqualtune. He was enslaved at the Santa Rita plantation in Pernambuco along with his brother Zona and sister Sabina. They escaped to Palmares. He rose to lead the confederation of ten mocambos (settlements) that formed Quilombo dos Palmares. By the 1670s, he had a palace at his royal compound Macaco with 1,500 houses, three wives, guards, ministers, and devoted subjects.

In Kikongo, "nganga a nzumbi" means "the priest responsible for the spiritual defense of the community" - indicating his role was as much spiritual as political.

In 1678, after devastating attacks, he accepted a peace treaty with the Portuguese. His nephew Zumbi opposed this treaty and led a revolt. Ganga Zumba was poisoned, likely by a relative, for making peace with the colonizers.
