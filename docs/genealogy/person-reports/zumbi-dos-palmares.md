| Full Name | Zumbi dos Palmares |

**Biography:**
Zumbi was the grandson of Princess Aqualtune and nephew of Ganga Zumba. Born free in Palmares, he was captured as an infant and given to a Portuguese priest who named him Francisco and taught him Portuguese and Latin. At age 15, he escaped back to Palmares. He became a military leader and strategist who organized and trained warriors.

When Ganga Zumba accepted a peace treaty with the Portuguese in 1678, Zumbi refused, believing it would lead to the re-enslavement of his people. He led a revolt, and Ganga Zumba was poisoned. Zumbi then led Palmares' resistance until 1694 when the quilombo was destroyed by a Portuguese expedition. He escaped but was betrayed and killed on November 20, 1695.

**Connection to Capoeira:**
While no direct historical evidence confirms Zumbi practiced capoeira as it's known today, the connection is deeply symbolic:
- Palmares is sometimes called "the birthplace of capoeira"
- The quilombo's military used Angolan combat techniques (sangha) and guerrilla tactics
- November 20 (day of his death) is Black Consciousness Day in Brazil
- His courageous spirit is said to "live on in capoeira"
- Many capoeira songs commemorate him

**Note:** Historical accounts describe Palmares warriors as armed with spears, bows, arrows, and guns - not capoeira. The association is more spiritual/symbolic than documented.
