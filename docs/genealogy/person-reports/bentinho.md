**Biography:**
Bentinho was an African boat commander who taught the young Manoel dos Reis Machado (later Mestre Bimba) beginning when Bimba was 12 years old. He was a captain of the Bahiana Navigation Company and taught on the old Boiada road in the Liberdade neighborhood of Salvador.

In a 1936 interview with the newspaper A Tarde, Mestre Bimba stated: "I adapted various blows from what is called capoeira de Angola, the style practiced by my mestre, the African Bentinho."

**Note:** Bimba also learned batuque (a related fighting-dance) from his father, Luis Cândido Machado, who was a batuque champion. The combination of capoeira from Bentinho and batuque from his father formed the foundation for Capoeira Regional.
