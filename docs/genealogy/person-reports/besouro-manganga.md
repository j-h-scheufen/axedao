**Biography:**
Besouro Mangangá ("Beetle of the Golden Cord") was born in Santo Amaro da Purificação in the Recôncavo region of Bahia - an area with deep African cultural roots. His nickname "Besouro" (beetle) referenced his agility and the belief he could escape danger like a flying beetle.

He learned capoeira from Tio Alípio, an African ex-slave, when he was a boy. He became famous for his exceptional capoeira skills and for standing up against oppression during intense racial discrimination in post-slavery Brazil.

**Spiritual Beliefs - Corpo Fechado:**
Besouro was believed to have a "corpo fechado" (closed body) - spiritual protection making him invulnerable to bullets and blades. This protection came through:
- The practice of "mandinga" (magic/sorcery)
- Wearing a "patuá" (magical amulet)
- Allegedly taught to him by an African named Pasquale, neighbor of his grandmother
- The term "Mangangá" itself refers to a magical spell creating corpo fechado

**Death (Legend):**
According to legend, his enemies knew killing Besouro would be difficult due to his corpo fechado. They allegedly paid a prostitute to get him drunk, sleep with him, and steal his patuá. One of the men then stabbed him in the back with a blade made from tucum wood - said to have magical properties able to penetrate a "closed body."
