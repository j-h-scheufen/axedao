## Biography

Manoel Henrique Pereira was born in 1895 in Santo Amaro da Purificação, in the Recôncavo region of Bahia—an area with deep African cultural roots. His father was João Matos Pereira, nicknamed "João Grosso," and his mother was Maria Haifa (also recorded as Maria Auta Pereira). According to Mestre Cobrinha Verde, his cousin: "Besouro's father was named João, nicknamed João Grosso, and his mother was Maria Haifa. Maria Haifa was my aunt, so Besouro was my cousin, and was raised as my brother."

### Early Training

As a boy, Besouro learned capoeira from Tio Alípio, an African ex-slave and Babalaô (Candomblé priest) who had been brought to Brazil in chains to work at the Engenho de Pantaleão sugar mill. Training took place in Trapiche de Baixo, the poorest neighborhood of Santo Amaro, done in secret because capoeira was forbidden by law (the 1890 penal code specifically targeted capoeira and Candomblé practice).

### Origin of His Nickname

His nickname "Besouro" (beetle) came from his ability to escape dangerous situations—people said he could scurry away or take flight like a beetle, evading capture. "Mangangá" derives from the African word (related to Bantu "nganga" meaning doctor) for a type of medicine taken in a ritual believed to create a "corpo fechado" (closed body), attributed to him because of his apparent invincibility to bullets and blades.

### Training Circle

Beyond Tio Alípio, Besouro trained with a circle of capoeiristas who would meet on Sundays: Paulo Barroquinha, Canário Pardo, Siri de Mangue, and Maria Doze Homens. Together they formed what some sources call a "gang of capoeira resistance fighters." He became a dangerous knife fighter (faquista), known for playing with a straight razor using his foot.

### Corpo Fechado (Closed Body)

Several legends arose around Besouro attributing to him a "closed body" (corpo fechado)—the belief that bullets and daggers could not hurt him. This protection allegedly came through:
- The practice of "mandinga" (magic/sorcery)
- Wearing a "patuá" (magical amulet)
- Spiritual practices passed down from African traditions

According to Mestre João Grande (2003): "Besouro had fava beans in his body... a bullet would hit him and fall to the ground."

### Military Service and Confrontations with Police

Besouro served in the army, stationed at the 31st Infantry Battalion. In September 1918, when police seized a berimbau from his group, he went to the police station in São Caetano, Salvador, to recover it. When the officer refused, Besouro attacked with companions. Repelled by police aided by local residents, he retreated to the 31st Infantry Battalion, gathered soldiers, and returned with a squad of 30 men to arrest the police officers. The neighborhood of São Caetano came to a halt. He was subsequently expelled from the army.

### Working Life

After the military, he worked as a saveirista (dock worker for traditional boats transiting between Salvador, Cachoeira and Maragogipe), as a vaqueiro (cowboy), and in sugar-cane plants. Historian Antonio Liberac Cardoso Simões Pires notes: "His practices cannot be associated with banditry, because Besouro has always characterized himself as a worker throughout his life, never being arrested for robbery, theft, or common criminal activity. His arrests were related to actions against the police, mainly during the period when he was in the army."

### Teaching

He began teaching his younger cousin, Rafael Alves França (later Mestre Cobrinha Verde), when Rafael was just four years old, around 1912. Besouro gave him the nickname "Cobrinha Verde" (little green snake) because of his quickness. On his deathbed, according to Cobrinha Verde: "Besouro called together all his students and told me that I, Cobrinha Verde, was the only one to whom he was giving his spirit to teach capoeira."

### Death (1924)

In July 1924, at around age 29, Besouro accepted work at the Maracangalha plantation from Dr. Zeca, a local landowner. According to legend written by Nestor Capoeira, he unwittingly carried a note—being illiterate—that read "kill the man who is delivering this card." He was surrounded by approximately forty armed men. When they opened fire, he dodged the bullets as usual.

But his protective patuá had allegedly been stolen by a woman the night before. A man named Eusébio de Quibaca (some sources: Eusébio de Quisaba) stabbed him in the back with a knife carved from tucum wood—a material said to have magical properties capable of penetrating a corpo fechado. The knife had reportedly been carved in the forest and blessed by an old Black sorceress specifically for this purpose.

Besouro was stabbed on July 6, 1924. He did not die immediately but was taken to the Santa Casa de Misericórdia hospital in Santo Amaro, where he died on July 8 (fifteen days later according to some accounts). His death certificate records:

> "Manoel Henrique, dark mulatto, single, 24 years old, native of Urupy, resident at Usina Maracangalha, profession of cattle herder, entered on the 8th of July 1924 at 10:30 hours of the day and died at seven o'clock in the evening, (due to) an injury piercing the section of the abdomen."

## Legacy

Shortly after his death, Besouro became a mythical capoeira hero. His fame spread nationally from the 1930s and internationally as capoeira expanded to other continents. He is celebrated in countless songs and stories:
- Subject of numerous capoeira songs performed worldwide
- 2009 Brazilian film "Besouro" (directed by João Daniel Tikhomiroff, with Ailton Carmo in the title role, fight choreography by Huan-Chiu Ku)
- His student Cobrinha Verde carried his legacy, teaching for free as Besouro had requested
