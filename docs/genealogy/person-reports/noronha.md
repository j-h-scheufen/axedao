**Biography:**
Daniel Coutinho was born in Salvador, Bahia, son of José Coutinho and Maria Conceição. He could read and write, which he considered himself educated for that time. At age 8 (1917), he began learning capoeira from Mestre Cândido Pequeno in Beco de Xaréu.

During the 1920s, Noronha, his brother Livino, and many other mestres founded the Centro de Capoeira Angola at Ladeira de Pedra (Gengibirra) in the Liberdade neighborhood. The center's colors were green and yellow (Brazilian flag colors).

Noronha and Mestre Livino also managed the "Centro de Capoeira Angola da Conceição da Praia."

In 1941, together with other mestres, they handed the Centro Nacional de Capoeira de Origem Angola to Mestre Pastinha after Amorzinho's death.

He worked various jobs: shoeshine boy, stevedore, dock worker, ragpicker, shipboard worker, truck driver assistant, street porter, and in the petrol industry.

In 1968, he participated in Jair Moura's film "Dança de Guerra." In 1976, he completed his manuscripts, published posthumously in 1993 as "O ABC da Capoeira Angola - Os Manuscritos do Mestre Noronha."
