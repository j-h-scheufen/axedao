**Biography:**
Mestre Amorzinho was a civil guard who led rodas at Gengibirra and offered protection from police harassment. According to Mestre Noronha, Amorzinho was one of the four "donos e proprietários" (owners and proprietors) of the first Capoeira Centre at Gengibirra, along with Noronha, Livinho, and Totonho de Maré.

In 1941, Amorzinho asked Mestre Pastinha to take over leadership of Capoeira Angola at Gengibirra. According to Mestre Noronha's memoirs, it was after Amorzinho's death that the mestres decided to hand the center to Pastinha.
