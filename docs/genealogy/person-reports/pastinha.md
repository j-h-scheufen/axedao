## Biography

### English

Vicente Ferreira Pastinha was born on April 5, 1889, on Rua do Tijolo in Salvador, Bahia. His father, José Señor Pastinha, was a Spanish peddler who owned a small shop. His mother, Maria Eugênia Ferreira, was a Black woman from Santo Amaro da Purificação who sold acarajé and did laundry. The two had little contact.

At ten years old, Pastinha faced a problem familiar to many small boys: a bigger kid bullied him regularly on Rua das Laranjeiras in the Pelourinho neighborhood. An elderly African neighbor named Benedito, native of Angola, watched these encounters and offered to teach the boy capoeira. For three years, young Vicente learned the art at Benedito's house at Rua das Laranjeiras, n° 26. After training, he defeated the bully. In later interviews, Pastinha spoke with deep gratitude about "Mestre Benedito, a black man native of Angola". When asked who taught him capoeira, he simply replied: "Um africano"—an African.

In 1902, at twelve years old, Pastinha's father enrolled him in the Escola de Aprendiz de Marineros (School of Naval Apprentices). At the school, Pastinha was assigned number 110. He served until age 20, working as a musician—a horn virtuoso—while secretly teaching capoeira to his fellow sailors. He also trained with sword and foil, studied guitar, and saved money at Caixa Economica bank.

After leaving the navy in 1909 or 1910, Pastinha worked various jobs: painter (trained at Liceu de Artes e Ofício), newspaper seller, shoe shiner, tailor, casino security guard, and laborer helping build Salvador's port. He played football with Esporte Clube Ypiranga—whose black and yellow colors would later define Capoeira Angola's uniform.

Then came a mysterious gap. According to his own writings, Pastinha "completely withdrew from the practice of capoeira" from 1912 until 1941—nearly thirty years. The reasons remain unclear.

In February 1941, everything changed. One of Pastinha's former students, Raimundo Aberrê, invited him to a Sunday roda at Ladeira de Gengibirra in the Liberdade neighborhood. The traditional Bahian capoeira had become known as "Capoeira de Angola" in opposition to Bimba's modernizing Regional style. A group of old mestres—including Amorzinho, Totonho de Maré, Noronha, and Livino—held regular rodas there. Amorzinho, a civil guard, offered protection from police harassment.

When Pastinha arrived on February 23, 1941, Amorzinho extended his hand and offered him the berimbau: "I have been waiting a long time to give you this capoeira for you to master". With Aberrê, Amorzinho, and Antonio Maré supporting him, the 52-year-old Pastinha accepted leadership of Capoeira Angola.

That same year, Pastinha founded the Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola (CECA)—the first academy dedicated specifically to the traditional style. The group reformed several times (1944, 1949) before official registration on October 1, 1952. In 1955, at age 66, Pastinha moved CECA to its famous address: Praça do Pelourinho, n° 19.

The academy became legendary. Students wore black pants and yellow shirts—Ypiranga's colors. Great names emerged: Mestre Curió, Albertino, Gildo Alfinete, Valdomiro, and above all, João Grande and João Pequeno—the two disciples to whom Pastinha entrusted his legacy.

In 1964, Pastinha published his book *Capoeira Angola*, with a cover by artist Carybé and text by writer Jorge Amado. In April 1966, Pastinha realized a dream: knowing Africa. He traveled to Dakar, Senegal, for the First International Festival of Black Arts, bringing his top students.

Tragedy struck in 1971. Pastinha became a victim of gentrification in Pelourinho. The city government ordered him to vacate the CECA building for "renovation" with promises of return. He piled his berimbaus, pandeiros, and benches into a room barely four square meters. The renovation completed—but Pastinha never returned. The building became a SENAC restaurant.

His health deteriorated. After two falls, he went blind. His wife Maria Romélia da Costa de Oliveira (Dona Nice) cared for him in a tiny room in Pelourinho. Eventually he was placed in Abrigo Dom Pedro II, a shelter for the elderly.

On April 12, 1981, Pastinha played his final roda. Seven months later, on November 13, 1981, he died of cerebral hemorrhage at age 92, blind, nearly paralyzed, and abandoned. His friend, the painter Carybé, paid for the funeral.

### Português

Vicente Ferreira Pastinha nasceu em 5 de abril de 1889, na Rua do Tijolo em Salvador, Bahia. Seu pai, José Señor Pastinha, era um mascate espanhol que possuía uma pequena loja. Sua mãe, Maria Eugênia Ferreira, era uma mulher negra de Santo Amaro da Purificação que vendia acarajé e lavava roupa.

Aos dez anos, um vizinho africano idoso chamado Benedito, natural de Angola, observava Pastinha sendo intimidado por um garoto maior e ofereceu ensinar-lhe capoeira. Por três anos, o jovem Vicente aprendeu a arte na casa de Benedito na Rua das Laranjeiras, n° 26.

Em 1902, aos doze anos, seu pai o matriculou na Escola de Aprendiz de Marinheiros. Serviu até os 20 anos, trabalhando como músico enquanto ensinava capoeira aos colegas. Após deixar a marinha, trabalhou em vários empregos e jogou futebol no Esporte Clube Ypiranga—cujas cores definiriam o uniforme da Capoeira Angola.

Em fevereiro de 1941, Raimundo Aberrê convidou Pastinha para uma roda na Ladeira de Gengibirra. Em 23 de fevereiro de 1941, Amorzinho passou-lhe a liderança da Capoeira Angola.

Naquele ano, Pastinha fundou o Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola (CECA). Em 1955, mudou-se para Praça do Pelourinho, n° 19. Em 1964, publicou *Capoeira Angola*. Em 1966, representou o Brasil no Festival de Artes Negras em Dakar.

Em 1971, foi despejado do prédio do CECA. Morreu em 13 de novembro de 1981, cego e abandonado.

## Philosophy and Quotes

**On Capoeira's Nature:**
> "Angola, capoeira mãe. Mandinga de escravo em ânsia de liberdade; seu princípio não tem método e seu fim é inconcebível ao mais sábio capoeirista".
>
> "Angola, mother of Capoeira. Sorcery of slaves in the longing for freedom; its beginning has no method and its end is inconceivable to even the most knowledgeable capoeirista".

**On Teaching Method:**
> "Capoeira de Angola can only be taught without forcing the person's natural expression".

**On His Students:**
> "They will be the greatest Capoeira players of the future and I have worked hard with them, and for them, to achieve this. They will be true masters. Not just impromptu teachers, as can be found anywhere, who only destroy our tradition which is so beautiful".

**On Fighting:**
> "Capoeira is not an attacking martial art, it waits. The good capoeirista is obligated to cry at the foot of his attacker".

**On His Own Playing:**
