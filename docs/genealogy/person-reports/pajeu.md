**Biography:**
Pajéu was known for pretending to be a capoeirista and for beating women - something that particularly disgusted Nascimento Grande. When Pajéu attacked Nascimento Grande with a knife (peixeira), Nascimento disarmed him in two seconds, gave him a beating, and publicly humiliated him by forcing him to wear women's clothing.
