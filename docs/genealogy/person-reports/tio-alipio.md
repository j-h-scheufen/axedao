## Biography

Tio Alípio was an African man who was brought to Brazil in chains to work at the Engenho Pantaleão sugar mill in Santo Amaro da Purificação, Bahia. According to Mestre Cobrinha Verde, interviewed by researchers documenting the Velhos Mestres project, he was "o mestre mais famoso dentro de Santo Amaro" (the most famous master in Santo Amaro).

### African Origins

His mother came from Africa on a slave ship (tumbeiro) that departed from the Port of São Jorge da Mina in Dahomey (present-day Benin). Alípio himself was enslaved while still young by a wealthy family ("escravo de gente de posse ainda moço jovem"). At the Engenho Pantaleão plantation, he endured the sufferings of slavery—"crescido no sofrimento da escravidão, onde passou por maus tratos até vir a abolição" (raised in the suffering of slavery, where he was mistreated until abolition came).

**Geographic note:** The sources describe his mother as coming from "Porto de São Jorge da Mina, do Daomé." São Jorge da Mina (Elmina Castle) is actually in present-day Ghana, while Dahomey is present-day Benin—these were distinct but connected slave-trading regions. Slaves from the Dahomey kingdom were sometimes processed through the Elmina trading post. His actual African ethnic origin remains uncertain.

### Spiritual Role

Beyond his skill as a capoeirista, Alípio was a Babalaô—a diviner and spiritual priest in the Yoruba/Candomblé tradition. This dual role as martial arts teacher and spiritual leader was characteristic of African capoeira masters in this era, who transmitted both fighting techniques and religious practices as an integrated cultural system.

### After Abolition

Following the Lei Áurea (Golden Law) that abolished slavery in May 1888, Alípio moved to Trapiche de Baixo—described in multiple sources as "the poorest neighborhood of Santo Amaro." There he continued to practice and teach capoeira, though the art remained criminalized under the 1890 Penal Code.

### Teaching Besouro

His most famous student was the young Manoel Henrique Pereira, later known as Besouro Mangangá. Besouro came to study under Alípio around 1908, when he moved to Trapiche de Baixo at about thirteen years old. The old African taught him in the sugarcane fields around the plantation:

> "Tio Alípio ensinou a Besouro os mistérios da capoeira, do jogo, das facas e das boas orações"
> (Tio Alípio taught Besouro the mysteries of capoeira, of the game, of knives and of good prayers)

The teaching took place in secret, as being caught meant severe punishment under the anti-capoeira laws.

### Legacy

The significance of Tio Alípio extends beyond his own life. He represents the direct transmission of African martial and spiritual traditions to Brazilian soil. Through his student Besouro, and Besouro's student Cobrinha Verde, his teachings eventually reached Mestre João Grande and Mestre João Pequeno—creating a lineage that connects living masters to the era of slavery.

## Unverified Claims

**"Sentenced to death":** Some secondary sources claim Tio Alípio was sentenced to death for teaching capoeira. No primary sources have been found to verify this claim. During this period, capoeira practitioners faced severe legal penalties including imprisonment and internal exile (desterro), but the specific claim of a death sentence remains unverified and may be a later embellishment.

## Connection to Roda de Trapiche de Baixo

After abolition, Tio Alípio was part of the informal capoeira community that formed in Trapiche de Baixo. This proto-group, documented as "Roda de Trapiche de Baixo" in the genealogy, represents the social structure through which capoeira was transmitted from enslaved Africans to subsequent generations.
