**Biography:**
Tio Alípio was an African who was brought to Brazil in chains to work at the Engenho de Pantaleão sugar mill. He lived in Trapiche de Baixo, the poorest neighborhood of Santo Amaro da Purificação.

He taught capoeira to the young Manoel Henrique Pereira (later Besouro Mangangá) when Besouro was still a boy. This occurred at the end of the 19th century, during a time when Brazilian law prohibited Afro-Brazilian expressions like capoeira, with severe punishments for those caught practicing.
