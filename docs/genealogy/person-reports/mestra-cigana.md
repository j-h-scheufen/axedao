**Biography:**
Fátima Colombiano started practicing capoeira in 1970 in the state of Pará with Mestre Bezerra. At that time, prejudice against female capoeiristas was severe. She faced harassment from male mestres throughout her career - one of the main reasons she didn't stay long in any group.

In 1975, she met Mestre Canjiquinha in São Paulo and went to Salvador, Bahia, to train with him. After five years of training, she was consecrated as mestra in 1980.

She married an engineer because she couldn't bear to live with her family anymore, who rejected her for being a capoeirista. Her husband also demanded she choose between capoeira and living with him and their three children.

She is responsible for the Associação de Mestre Canjiquinha in Volta Redonda and trained Mestras Luana and Arara in Rio de Janeiro.
