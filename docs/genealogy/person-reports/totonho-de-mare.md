**Biography:**
Mestre Totonho de Maré was a contemporary of Mestre Bimba and Mestre Pastinha. He began playing capoeira in 1911 but never founded an academy. He taught many people at street parties in different neighborhoods of Salvador. For many years he "reigned" in Ilha de Maré, which is where he got his nickname.

According to Mestre Noronha, Totonho de Maré was one of the four "donos e proprietários" (owners and proprietors) of Gengibirra, along with Amorzinho, Livinho, and Noronha himself.

In 1968, he participated in the film "Dança de Guerra" by Jair Moura, which includes footage of him playing with Mestre Noronha.
