| Famous For | Defeating Sada Miyako (jiu-jitsu), May 1, 1909 |

**The Historic Fight (May 1, 1909):**
At Concerto Avenida in Rio de Janeiro, Cyriaco faced Sada Miyako, a Japanese jiu-jitsu fighter considered invincible. This is considered perhaps the first professional Vale Tudo match in Brazilian history.

Miyako was immediately knocked down with a capoeira kick called "Rabo de Arraia" (Stingray's Tail). He got up but was hit again with the same kick and knocked out.

The magazine O Malho declared "the purely national game had the honors of victory and defeated the Japanese game." The newspaper A Notícia compared Cyriaco to Santos Dumont and called him a world champion.

Despite capoeira being prohibited, Cyriaco demonstrated his techniques twice at the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro. Miyako's reputation never recovered.
