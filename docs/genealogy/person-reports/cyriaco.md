## Biography

Francisco da Silva Cyríaco was born in 1871 among the sugar cane fields of Campos dos Goytacazes in northern Rio de Janeiro state—a time when slavery still existed in Brazil. By the early 1900s, he had made his way to the capital, where he worked as a stevedore carrying sacks of coffee from the docks to downtown Rio. In the violent streets of Rio de Janeiro's belle époque, he earned a reputation as one of the most skilled capoeiristas in Brazil.

### The Historic Fight (May 1, 1909)

On May 1, 1909, Cyriaco stepped into the ring at the Pavilhão Internacional of Paschoal Segreto for what many consider the first professional Vale Tudo match in Brazilian history. His opponent was Sada Miyako, a Japanese jiu-jitsu expert hired by the Brazilian Navy to teach hand-to-hand combat. Miyako had been challenging all comers to public matches and was considered invincible.

The public practice of capoeira was outlawed by the Republican Criminal Code of 1890, making Cyriaco's very presence a legal risk. But the medical school students of the National Academy of Medicine—emboldened by nationalist fervor—had informally "adopted" him, urging him to defend what they considered a Brazilian combat art. After insistent requests, the law was relaxed.

Cyriaco declared: "I am quite confident in my skills. If I have a shot, I will not disappoint you."

He was forced to wear the traditional jiu-jitsu uniform (gi), intended to make the Afro-Brazilian fighter appear "respectable." But inside the ring, Cyriaco fought his way. Using capoeira's characteristic ginga to keep Miyako off-balance, he evaded a morote gari (double-leg takedown) attempt. Then he struck: a devastating rabo de arraia (stingray tail kick) connected with Miyako's head and knocked him down. The Japanese fighter rose but was immediately hit with the same kick a second time and knocked unconscious.

The match lasted mere seconds. The audience erupted. They carried Cyriaco on their shoulders through the streets crying: "Asia kneels to Brazil!"

### Aftermath and Legacy

The magazine O Malho ran a headline on May 15, 1909: "Jiu-jitsu versus Capoeira: Cyríaco, the hero." The newspaper A Notícia compared him to Santos Dumont and called him a world champion. Despite capoeira being prohibited, Cyriaco gave demonstrations at the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro.

Watching Cyriaco's victory inspired young Agenor Moreira Sampaio (later Mestre Sinhozinho) to seek out capoeira training on the hill of Santo Antônio.

Three years after his triumph, on May 18, 1912, Cyriaco died at age 38 from a cardiac lesion. The Correio da Manhã announced: "Cyriaco, campeão da capoeiragem nacional, falleceu hontem."

Today, a community library in Campos dos Goytacazes bears his name: Biblioteca Comunitária Francisco da Silva Cyríaco.
