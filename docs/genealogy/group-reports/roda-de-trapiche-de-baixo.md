## Important Clarification

**This was NOT a formal school.** There was no building with a sign, no official registration, no membership fees. "Trapiche de Baixo" was a neighborhood—the poorest in Santo Amaro—where a community of capoeiristas lived, trained together, and held regular rodas. The sources describe the area itself as becoming Besouro's "school" in the sense of his training ground and community.

What makes this a "group" worthy of documentation:
- Regular, organized training sessions (Sundays and folk festivals)
- Consistent core members who all lived in the area
- Recognized rodas that "hypnotized anybody that would go by"
- Teacher-student relationships (Tio Alípio → Besouro → Cobrinha Verde)
- Collective identity as "capoeira resistance fighters" who backed each other up

## History

Trapiche de Baixo was a waterfront neighborhood in Santo Amaro da Purificação, in the Recôncavo Baiano region. The area had strong African cultural roots, as Santo Amaro's population grew through the trafficking of enslaved Africans to work the sugar cane plantations.

Around 1888, an African man named Alípio—a former slave from Dahomey (present-day Benin) who had been held captive at the Engenho Pantaleão sugar mill—moved to Trapiche de Baixo. Alípio was a Babalaô (Candomblé priest) and a practitioner of capoeira. He began teaching capoeira in the neighborhood, passing on "the mysteries of capoeira, the game, the knives and the good prayers."

Around 1908, when the young Manoel Henrique Pereira (later Besouro Mangangá) was approximately 13 years old, he left home and moved to Trapiche de Baixo. One source describes the neighborhood as "a suburban zone of the city which becomes his school." He learned capoeira from Tio Alípio while working in the sugar cane fields—training was integrated with daily labor.

As Besouro grew in skill and reputation, a community of capoeiristas formed around him. According to sources, "in the capoeira rodas of Trapiche de Baixo and in the folk parties, the young Besouro started to make a name for himself." His companions—Paulo Barroquinha, Boca de Siri (Siri de Mangue), Noca de Jacó, Doze Homens (Maria Doze Homens), and Canário Pardo—all lived in Trapiche de Baixo and trained together regularly.

The group held "memorable capoeira rodas that hypnotized anybody that would go by." They trained together on Sundays and at folk festivals, forming what one source calls "a gang of capoeira resistance fighters who trained together on Sundays, and could always be relied upon to back one another up."

Because capoeira was illegal during this period (criminalized in the 1890 Penal Code), training had to be done in secret. When police appeared, Besouro would send his students away and face the authorities alone.

Around 1912, Besouro began teaching his young cousin Rafael Alves França (later Mestre Cobrinha Verde), who was about 4 years old. On his deathbed in 1924, Besouro reportedly told Cobrinha Verde that he was "the only one to whom he was giving his spirit to teach capoeira."

When Besouro was killed in July 1924, "capoeira rodas across Bahia ceased for weeks as a sign of mourning." The informal community of Trapiche de Baixo appears to have dispersed, though individual members continued practicing and teaching elsewhere. Siri de Mangue and Canário Pardo later taught Mestre Waldemar; Cobrinha Verde continued teaching and eventually worked alongside Mestre Pastinha.

## Lineage Significance

This informal group represents a critical link in capoeira genealogy:

```
Tio Alípio (African, ex-slave, Babalaô)
    ↓
Besouro Mangangá + training companions
    ↓
Cobrinha Verde
    ↓
João Grande, João Pequeno
    ↓
[Modern Angola lineages]
```

The Trapiche de Baixo community also influenced the teachers of Mestre Waldemar (Siri de Mangue, Canário Pardo), creating another branch of transmission.

## Location Context

**Santo Amaro da Purificação** is located in the Recôncavo Baiano, 79 km from Salvador. It was one of the first cities in the region, built on the banks of the Rio Subaé. The economy was based on sugar cane, and the population grew through the African slave trade.

**Trapiche de Baixo** was (and remains) the poorest neighborhood of Santo Amaro. A "trapiche" is a waterfront warehouse/dock area. The neighborhood's poverty and marginality made it a space where African cultural practices like capoeira could persist despite criminalization.

Today, capoeira classes continue in Trapiche de Baixo as part of cultural tourism honoring Santo Amaro's capoeira heritage. Mestre Bendengó teaches on Rua do Tauá in the neighborhood.
