# Case Study: Cordão de Ouro (Golden Cord)

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Status**: Initial Research
**Category**: Large International Network, Contemporânea Style

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE group out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect only this specific large international network. Smaller groups, regional organizations, Angola-focused groups, and independent mestres may have completely different structures and practices.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**No Universal Patterns**: What appears to be a "pattern" across 4 large networks may not apply to the broader Capoeira community. Further research across diverse group types is required.

---

## Organizational Structure

### Observed Pattern

```
Associação de Capoeira Cordão de Ouro
├─ Academia Matriz Mestre Suassuna (Main/Mother Academy)
│   └─ São Paulo, Brazil
│   └─ Contact: +55 (11) 99979-5357
│
├─ Academias Credenciadas (Accredited Academies)
│   ├─ Brazil (multiple locations)
│   ├─ Angola, Africa
│   │   ├─ Escola Don Bosco, Sambizanga-Lixeira
│   │   │   └─ Instructor: Bola 8

│   ├─ USA
│   ├─ Europe
│   └─ ... (multiple countries)
│
└─ Regional Representatives
    └─ Example: Mestre Esquilo (Sete Lagoas, Brazil)
```

### Terminology Observations

**"Academias Credenciadas" (Accredited Academies)**:
- Contrast with Axé Capoeira's "Grupo [Name] [City]" pattern
- Implies a formal accreditation/approval process
- Local academias appear to have more naming autonomy

**"Academia Matriz" (Main/Mother Academy)**:
- Headquarters/founding location
- Mestre Suassuna's academy in São Paulo
- "Matriz" = mother/main - implies parent organization

### Supervision Hierarchy

**Multi-level supervision observed** (Angola example):
- **Local level**: Instructors (Bola 8, Bola) run day-to-day operations
- **Regional level**: Supervised by Mestre Espirrinho / Contramestra Mordaça
- **Central level**: Coordination with Academia Matriz

**Questions**:
- Are all academias supervised, or only some?
- What is Mestre Espirrinho's formal role? Regional coordinator?
- How often does supervision involve in-person visits vs. remote coordination?

---

## Key Features

### 1. Formal Registry System

**Official registration required**:
- Website states: "Professores, Contramestres e Mestres filiados ao Grupo Cordão de Ouro" must complete official registration
- Suggests organizational control and quality standards
- Tracks affiliated instructors at various levels

**Questions**:
- What does registration entail?
- Are there fees or requirements?
- What benefits/responsibilities come with registration?
- Can registration be revoked?

### 2. Accreditation Process

**Academias must be accredited**:
- Website notes that unaccredited academias or individuals can apply for accreditation
- Suggests formal vetting and approval process
- Quality control mechanism

**Comparison with Axé**:
- Axé: Appears more centralized (all use same name/logo)
- CDO: Accreditation model allows more local autonomy while maintaining standards

**Questions**:
- What are accreditation criteria?
- Who approves accreditation applications?
- Can accreditation be lost? Under what circumstances?

### 3. Certification System (Certificado de Alvará)

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Cordão de Ouro has a formal certification/licensing system that reveals the true organizational mechanics.

**Official certificate page**: https://cordaodeouro.com.br/certificado-de-alvara/

**What the certificate authorizes**:
- Legal use of the Cordão de Ouro **registered trademark** (logo and name)
- Officially recognized affiliation status
- Right to conduct classes and events under the Cordão de Ouro name

**Who must obtain it**:
- All "Professores, Contramestres e Mestres do Grupo Cordão de Ouro"
- Required to legally operate under the group's name

**Key requirements**:

1. **Annual fee**: "O filiado pagará uma taxa anual" (The affiliate will pay an annual fee)
   - Amount not disclosed publicly (must contact organization)
   - Payment via bank transfer
   - Annual renewal required

2. **Event approval**: Cannot host events without approval from Academia Matriz (Mestre Suassuna)
   - Significant organizational control
   - Prevents unauthorized use of brand

3. **Mandatory training**: Annual "recycling courses" required for instructors above yellow-blue cord level
   - Quality control mechanism
   - Continuing education requirement

4. **Supervision requirements**: Advanced students must be supervised by group leadership or state representatives
   - Ensures quality standards
   - Maintains connection to central organization

**What this reveals**:

**Brand protection mechanism**:
- The logo/name is a **registered trademark** - unauthorized use is illegal
- This explains why certification is needed - it's a legal licensing agreement
- Likely response to groups claiming to be CDO without authorization

**Financial relationship**:
- Annual fees create ongoing financial relationship with matriz
- Not disclosed publicly (may vary by region/size?)
- Creates dependency and commitment

**Quality control**:
- Mandatory training requirements ensure instructors stay current
- Event approval prevents damage to brand reputation
- Supervision requirements maintain standards

**Organizational power structure**:
- Mestre Suassuna (via Academia Matriz) has significant control:
  - Must approve all events
  - Can revoke certification
  - Controls who can legally use trademark
- Creates clear hierarchy despite "accredited" model appearing autonomous

**Questions**:
- What happens if someone operates without certificate? Legal action?
- Can certificates be revoked? Under what circumstances?
- How are fees determined? (size of academia, location, revenue?)
- Who enforces these requirements?
- What are the annual training courses like?

**User insight**: "This smells more like they had problems with groups just claiming to be Cordao de Ouro, but not paying respect (or money)?"
- Exactly right. This is a formalization in response to unauthorized use
- Protects brand integrity
- Ensures quality standards
- Creates financial sustainability for organization

### 4. Geographic Organization

**Continental/country-based navigation**:
- Website organized by continent, then country
- Interactive map/image selection
- Shows true international reach

**Countries mentioned**: Brazil, Angola (Africa), USA, Europe (specific countries unclear from initial research)

### 4. Co-Founder Model

**Two founders**: Mestre Suassuna AND Mestre Brasília
- Contrast with single-founder models (e.g., Axé - Mestre Barrão)
- Both credited equally in founding narrative

**Questions**:
- What role does/did Mestre Brasília play?
- Is he still active in the organization?
- How did co-leadership work?
- Is there a succession plan?

---

## Observed Patterns

### 1. Organizational Model: Certified Licensing Network

**Key characteristics**:
- Central organization (Associação) with registered trademark
- Main academy (Academia Matriz) with veto power over events
- Certified academias (less autonomous than initially appeared)
- Formal certification/licensing system with annual fees
- Quality control through mandatory training and supervision
- Legal enforcement mechanism (trademark protection)

**Important realization**: The certification system reveals MORE central control than "accreditation" implied:
- Annual fees create financial dependency
- Event approval required from matriz
- Mandatory training courses
- Trademark enforcement provides legal leverage

**Spectrum positioning (REVISED)**:
```
Centralized ←------------------------→ Autonomous
(Axé model)    (CDO model)             (Fully independent)
             (less autonomous
              than appeared)
```

Cordão de Ouro is actually closer to centralized than initially appeared. The "accredited academias" language suggests autonomy, but the certification requirements create significant central control.

### 2. Supervision & Coordination

**Observed hierarchy**:
- Local instructors (may not be mestres)
- Regional supervisors (mestres/contramestres)
- Central coordination (founders/leadership)

**Example**: Angola academias supervised by Mestre Espirrinho/Contramestra Mordaça
- Both academias share same supervision team
- Suggests regional/country-level coordination structure

### 3. Leadership Structure

**Multi-level titles**:
- Mestres (highest level, founders and senior leaders)
- Contramestres (senior instructors, regional coordinators)
- Professores (instructors, can run academias)
- Local instructors (may have lower titles)

**Registration requirement**: All filiados (affiliated members) at Professor level and above must register

### 4. International Expansion

**African presence notable**:
- Academias in Angola, Africa
- Culturally significant (Capoeira's African roots)
- Shows commitment to international spread beyond wealthy Western countries

### 5. Relationship Maintenance

**Autonomous affiliates maintain ties**:
- Example: Cai Na Capoeira (NY, USA)
  - Has own name and logo (autonomous branding)
  - Founded by Contra-Mestre Cabeção (student of Mestre Esquilo)
  - Explicitly states affiliation with Cordão de Ouro
  - Cabeção maintains relationship with Mestre Esquilo

**Pattern**: Network allows affiliated groups to maintain their own identity while staying connected

| **Enforcement Mechanism** | Trademark law + certificate revocation | Unknown |

**Both share**:
- Large international networks
- Multiple countries/continents
- Simple web presence (manual data)
- Local leaders with various titles
- Geographic organization of locations

## Potential Data Model Implications

**Caveat**: Preliminary observations - need more examples before schema changes.

### Certification/Licensing System

**New concept**: Formal certification with legal trademark licensing, annual fees, and event approval requirements

**Real-world example**: Cordão de Ouro's "Certificado de Alvará"

**What this captures**:
- Legal right to use trademarked name/logo
- Certification status (active, expired, revoked)
- Financial relationship (annual fees)
- Event approval requirements
- Mandatory training requirements
- Renewal tracking

**Possible implementation**:

```typescript
// New table: group_certifications
export const groupCertifications = pgTable('group_certifications', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),

  // Which group is certified
  groupId: uuid('group_id').references(() => groups.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }).notNull(),

  // Which parent organization issued the certification
  parentGroupId: uuid('parent_group_id').references(() => groups.id).notNull(),

  // Certification status
  status: enum('certification_status', [
    'active',
    'expired',
    'pending_renewal',
    'revoked',
    'suspended'
  ]).notNull(),

  // Dates
  issuedAt: timestamp('issued_at').notNull(),
  expiresAt: timestamp('expires_at'), // null if lifetime
  lastRenewedAt: timestamp('last_renewed_at'),
  revokedAt: timestamp('revoked_at'),

  // Who issued/revoked
  issuedBy: uuid('issued_by').references(() => users.id),
  revokedBy: uuid('revoked_by').references(() => users.id),
  revocationReason: text('revocation_reason'),

  // Requirements/constraints
  requiresAnnualFee: boolean('requires_annual_fee').default(true),
  requiresEventApproval: boolean('requires_event_approval').default(false),
  requiresMandatoryTraining: boolean('requires_mandatory_training').default(false),

  // Notes
  notes: text('notes'),

  // Metadata
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at').notNull().$onUpdate(() => new Date()),
});

// In groups table, add trademark info
// groups table additions:
trademarked: boolean('trademarked').default(false),
trademarkRegistrationNumber: varchar('trademark_registration_number'),
requiresCertificationForAffiliation: boolean('requires_certification_for_affiliation').default(false),
```

**Alternative simpler approach**: Add to `group_hierarchy` table:
```typescript
// In group_hierarchy table
certification_status: enum('certification_status', ['active', 'expired', 'revoked']),
certification_issued_at: timestamp('certification_issued_at'),
certification_expires_at: timestamp('certification_expires_at'),
requires_annual_fee: boolean('requires_annual_fee').default(false),
requires_event_approval: boolean('requires_event_approval').default(false),
```

**Questions for implementation**:
- Should we track fee amounts? (may be private/sensitive)
- Should we track payment history? (probably not - leave to accounting systems)
- How to model event approval workflow?
- Should certification be a relationship attribute or separate entity?

### Registration System

**New concept**: Individual instructors register with parent organization

**Possible implementation**:
```typescript
// In person_profiles or new table?
registered_with_groups: json('registered_with_groups').$type<{
  groupId: string;
  registeredAt: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'revoked';
}[]>(),

// Or separate table: instructor_registrations
```

### Supervision Hierarchy

**New concept**: Regional supervisors oversee multiple local academias

**Observed pattern**:
- Local academias → Regional supervisor(s) → Central organization

**Possible implementation**:
```typescript
// In group_roles table
supervision_region: varchar('supervision_region'), // e.g., "Angola", "Northeast Brazil"

// Or in person_relationships?
relationship_type: 'supervises', // Mestre Espirrinho supervises Bola 8
```

### Matriz/Mother Academy

**New terminology**: "Academia Matriz" for headquarters

**Possible implementation**:
```typescript
// In groups table
is_matriz: boolean('is_matriz').default(false),
// Or use existing is_headquarters field

organization_role: enum('organization_role', [
  'matriz',           // Mother/main academy
  'accredited',       // Accredited affiliate
  'branch',           // Direct branch
  'affiliated',       // Loosely affiliated
  'independent'       // No affiliation
]),
```

### Co-Founder Model

**Already supported** by `group_roles` table with multiple `co_founder` entries

**Verification needed**:
- Current schema should handle multiple co-founders
- May need UI updates to display all co-founders

---

## Implications for Quilombo

### 1. Affiliation Verification Challenges

**Problem identified**: The certification system reveals that groups can CLAIM affiliation without authorization.

**Scenarios Quilombo must handle**:

1. **Unauthorized claims**:
   - Group claims to be "Cordão de Ouro [City]" without certification
   - Lists CDO as parent organization
   - May use similar branding/logo

2. **Expired certifications**:
   - Group was certified but let it lapse (didn't pay annual fee)
   - Still claims CDO affiliation
   - CDO may not recognize them

3. **Revoked certifications**:
   - Group had certification revoked (violated rules, quality issues)
   - Still claims affiliation on their website/Quilombo profile

4. **Disputed affiliations**:
   - Group claims to be affiliated
   - Parent organization disputes this
   - Who is Quilombo to believe?

**Current Quilombo limitation**:
- Groups can self-report their affiliations
- No verification mechanism for claims
- Could lead to trademark disputes if unauthorized groups listed

**Possible solutions**:

**A. Verification badge system**:
```typescript
// In group_hierarchy table
verification_status: enum('verification_status', [
  'self_reported',       // Group claims this, not verified
  'verified',            // Confirmed by parent org admin
  'disputed',            // Parent org disputes this claim
  'expired',             // Was verified, now expired
  'revoked'              // Was verified, now revoked
]),
verified_at: timestamp('verified_at'),
verified_by: uuid('verified_by').references(() => users.id),
```

**B. Require parent org approval**:
- When group claims affiliation, send notification to parent org admins
- Parent org must approve before relationship appears publicly
- Similar to group claim approval workflow

**C. Display disclaimers**:
- Show "Self-reported affiliation" badge for unverified claims
- Show "Verified by [Parent Org]" for approved relationships
- Protect Quilombo from liability

**D. Allow parent orgs to manage their network**:
- Give parent org admins tools to:
  - List their official affiliates
  - Approve/reject affiliation claims
  - Revoke affiliations (with reason)
  - Update certification statuses

### 2. Trademark Protection Concerns

**Issue**: Displaying groups that claim to represent trademarked organizations could create legal liability for Quilombo.

**CDO example**:
- Logo and name are registered trademarks
- Unauthorized use is illegal
- CDO could potentially hold Quilombo liable for facilitating unauthorized use

**Mitigation strategies**:

1. **Terms of Service clauses**:
   - Groups agree they have legal right to use names/logos they claim
   - Indemnification clause protecting Quilombo
   - Takedown policy for trademark violations

2. **Verification before display**:
   - Don't display affiliation publicly until verified
   - Require trademark holders to approve

3. **Dispute resolution process**:
   - Allow trademark holders to report violations
   - Temporary suspension pending investigation
   - Clear appeal process

### 3. Financial Relationship Data

**Question**: Should Quilombo track financial relationships (fees, payments)?

**Arguments for tracking**:
- Part of organizational structure
- Helps distinguish paid affiliates from informal connections
- Important for understanding relationship depth

**Arguments against tracking**:
- Private/sensitive financial information
- Could create legal/tax complications
- Groups may not want to disclose
- Not core to Quilombo's mission (community building, not accounting)

**Recommended approach**:
- Track EXISTENCE of financial relationship (yes/no)
- Don't track amounts or payment history
- Let groups use external accounting systems

### 4. Event Approval Workflows

**Discovered requirement**: Some parent orgs require approval for events hosted by affiliates.

**Question**: Should Quilombo support event approval workflows?

**Possible features**:
- Event creation requires approval from parent org if group is certified
- Notification to parent org admins when affiliate creates event
- Parent org can approve/reject/request changes
- Event marked as "Approved by [Parent Org]" or "Pending approval"

**Complexity considerations**:
- Adds significant workflow complexity
- May not be needed for all groups (only certified affiliates)
- Could be future enhancement rather than MVP

**Recommended approach**:
- Track event approval requirement as a boolean flag
- Don't build approval workflow in MVP
- Groups can coordinate event approvals outside Quilombo initially

### 5. Certification Status Display

**User experience question**: How to show certification status to users?

**Options**:

**A. Badges on group profiles**:
- "Certified by Cordão de Ouro ✓" (active certification)
- "Affiliated with Cordão de Ouro" (self-reported)
- "Certification expired" (was certified, now lapsed)

**B. Detailed affiliation info**:
- Show certification dates
- Link to parent org's official page
- Display verification status

**C. Trust indicators**:
- Similar to verified accounts on social media
- Blue checkmark for verified affiliations
- Gray indicator for self-reported

## Import Opportunities

### Location Data Scraping

**URL**: https://cordaodeouro.com.br/academias/

**Structure**:
- Geographic organization (continent → country)
- Each location page lists academias with:
  - Academia name
  - Address/location
  - Instructor name
  - Supervisor(s)
  - Contact info (phone, email)

**Potential value**:
- Structured data for multiple countries
- Includes supervision relationships
- Contact information for outreach

**Challenges**:
- Manual pages, not API
- May require page-by-page scraping
- Data format varies by country page

**Similar to**: Axé Capoeira's location finder
- Pattern: Large networks have geographic location pages
- Could build reusable scraper template

---

## Related Examples

### Contrast with Axé Capoeira
- **Axé**: Centralized branding, single founder, direct branches
- **CDO**: Accreditation model, co-founders, more autonomy

### Contrast with Cai Na Capoeira
- **Cai Na Capoeira**: Autonomous group affiliated with CDO
- **CDO**: Parent organization that allows autonomous affiliates

### Pattern Emerging
**Spectrum of affiliation models**:
1. **Highly centralized**: All locations use exact same name/logo (Axé model)
2. **Accredited network**: Central standards, local autonomy (CDO model)
3. **Loose affiliation**: Own identity, cultural ties (Cai Na Capoeira with CDO)
4. **Fully independent**: No formal affiliation

Groups can exist at different points on this spectrum.

---

## Next Steps

### Research Tasks
1. Investigate accreditation criteria and process
2. Research Mestre Brasília's role and current status
3. Map full geographic distribution of academias
4. Study other accreditation-based networks (do they exist?)
5. Explore how regional supervision works in practice
6. Look for other co-founder examples

### Documentation Tasks
1. Create case study for ABADÁ-Capoeira (another large network)
2. Document spectrum of affiliation models
3. Map common organizational patterns
4. Create comparison matrix of major groups

### Technical Tasks
1. Analyze feasibility of scraping location pages
2. Identify which CDO academias already in Quilombo
3. Design schema for accreditation/registration systems (if needed)
