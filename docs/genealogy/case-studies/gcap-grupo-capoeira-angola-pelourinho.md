# Case Study: Grupo de Capoeira Angola Pelourinho (GCAP)

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Founded**: 1980 (Rio de Janeiro)
**Moved to Salvador**: 1982
**Founders**: Four co-founders (Moraes, Braga, Neco, Zé Carlos)
**Primary Leader**: Mestre Moraes (Pedro Moraes Trindade)
**Location**: Salvador, Bahia, Brazil (Forte Santo Antônio Além do Carmo)
**Style**: Capoeira Angola (Traditional - Pastinha lineage, African roots focus)
**Scale**: International (Brazil, Japan, USA)

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE group out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect only GCAP's specific structure and history. Other groups may have completely different organizational models.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**Historical Significance**: This case study is **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT** because GCAP led the "revival" or "resurrection" of Capoeira Angola in the 1980s when the traditional style was nearly extinct. Mestre Moraes is known as "O Ressuscitador da Tradição" (The Resuscitator of Tradition).

## Founding History - The Rio de Janeiro Origin (1980)

### The Four Co-Founders

**December 16, 1978** - The Precursor Event:
- **Location**: Parque Lage, Rio de Janeiro
- **Event**: Mestre Moraes granted mestre titles to three students
- **Recipients**: Braga, Neco, and Zé Carlos
- After training in Capoeira Angola with Mestre Moraes during his 12 years in Rio

**1980** - Founding of GCAP:
- **Founders**: Four mestres from Rio de Janeiro
  1. **Mestre Moraes** (Pedro Moraes Trindade) - primary leader
  2. **Mestre Braga**
  3. **Mestre Neco**
  4. **Mestre Zé Carlos**

- **Initial Location**: Rio de Janeiro
- **Name Significance**: "Pelourinho" in the name was a reference to the African cultural heritage of Capoeira Angola, not the actual Salvador neighborhood (yet)

### The Founding Vision

**Idea Originator**: Mestre Neco

**Purpose**: The association was meant to unite under the same label the masters of capoeira Angola from Rio (Moraes, Braga, Neco and Zé Carlos)

**Political Context**: The association aimed to fight the Brazilian government's persecution of African culture at the time

**Mission**: Preserving and transmitting the teachings of Moraes's mentors (Pastinha, João Grande, João Pequeno)

**Philosophy**: Return to capoeira's philosophical bases and its African, specifically Angolan roots, turning away from more commercial and martial-arts aspects

---

## The Return to Salvador (1982) - Finding Angola Nearly Extinct

### Mestre Moraes's Discovery

**1982**: Mestre Moraes returned to Salvador with his organization

**What he found**: "Capoeira Angola was almost extinct, the old mestres losing ground against the new elite of modern Capoeiristas"

**The Crisis**: Traditional Angola style was disappearing in its birthplace

**Moraes's Decision**: Left the three young masters (Braga, Neco, Zé Carlos) in Rio with full autonomy and responsibility to continue his teachings

### Finding a Home - Forte Santo Antônio

**1983**: GCAP established at Forte Santo Antônio Além do Carmo

**Location**: Same historic fort where Mestre João Pequeno had established CECA in 1982
- Praça Barão do Triunfo (Largo de Santo Antônio)
- Pelourinho historic center, Salvador, Bahia
- North side of historical center

**Building History**: 17th-century military fortress, later deactivated

**2006**: Fort renovation completed, renamed "Forte da Capoeira"

**Structure**: Houses two schools of capoeira (one on lower level, one on upper level)

**GCAP's Role**: Shares the historic fort space, contributing to its transformation into a cultural center

## The Revival of Capoeira Angola - "O Ressuscitador da Tradição"

### The 1980s Crisis

**Context**: When Moraes returned to Salvador in 1982, traditional Capoeira Angola was dying out

**Threats**:
- Old mestres losing ground to modern Capoeiristas
- Regional and Contemporânea styles dominating
- African cultural elements being lost
- Commercialization overshadowing tradition

**Velha Guarda (Old Guard)**: Mestre Pastinha, João Grande, João Pequeno, and others had kept Angola alive during challenging times, but the tradition was fading

### Key Revival Actions

**1. Founding GCAP (1980)**:
- Implemented series of actions promoting re-valorization of Capoeira Angola
- Recognized importance of old and famous mestres (especially Pastinha)
- Created institutional structure for preservation

**2. Convincing João Grande to Return (Mid-1980s)**:
- **Critical Achievement**: Mestre Moraes and Cobra Mansa persuaded João Grande to come out of retirement
- **João Grande had retired for 6 years**
- João Grande agreed to teach again for GCAP
- This return "brought back some heavy history into Capoeira"
- Sparked revival of interest in Angola's roots and philosophies

**3. Systematic Preservation**:
- GCAP students learned:
  - Rich history of the art
  - Movements
  - Songs
  - Instruments
- Community using Capoeira Angola as vehicle for social change

**4. Academic Documentation**:
- Moraes's Master's and Doctorate research documented tradition
- Intellectual/scholarly approach to preservation
- Cultural and historical validation

### The "Resurrection" Impact

**Title**: "O Ressuscitador da Tradição" (The Resuscitator of Tradition)

**Achievement**: Mestre Moraes had a major role in the resurrection of Capoeira Angola in the 1980s

**Result**: Revival of interest in Angola's traditional style, philosophy, and African roots

**Legacy**: Created institutional foundation for Angola's continuation into 21st century

## Philosophy and Cultural Mission

### Core Philosophy - Return to African Roots

**Moraes's Statement**: "Capoeira is not 'genuinely Brazilian' – what on earth has Brazil contributed to capoeira? The art is African because its roots come from Africans of various ethnicities; it's not just the region of the country now called Angola."

**Mission**: Devoted to promoting and preserving the African roots of capoeira

**Resistance**: "Ensure that it doesn't get ripped of its African roots and that it doesn't turn into a sport practiced by just anyone who hasn't recognized the blood, sweat & suffering people went through because for practicing African rituals on Brazilian soil"

**Ancestral Spirit**: GCAP sought to return to the more ancestral spirit of the art, versus commercialization

### Capoeira Angola Practice Philosophy

**Holistic Approach**:
- Cultivate chants, music, and culture
- Martial art component
- Keep capoeira as close to its African roots as possible

**Anti-Commercialization**:
- Turn away from commercial aspects
- Resist transformation into pure sport
- Preserve philosophical and cultural dimensions

**Cultural Resistance**:
- Fight against government persecution of African culture (1980 founding context)
- Maintain African cultural heritage
- Preserve tradition despite modernization pressures

### Connection to Angola, Africa

**Historical Research**: Efforts to understand African origins of capoeira

**Geographic Connection**: Not limited to modern Angola borders - recognizes diverse African ethnicities

**Cultural Journey**: Practitioners like Cobra Mansa have traveled to west-central Africa to search for African roots of capoeira

**Philosophy**: Reconnecting with African cultural and philosophical foundations

  shared_lineage: 'both_from_pastinha'
}
```

**Significant**: Two second-generation Pastinha groups preserving tradition at same site

### 6. Teacher-Student-Teacher Cycle

**Student convinced teacher to return**:

```typescript
relationships: [
  {
    relationship_type: 'student_teacher',
    from: uuid,                               // Moraes (student)

    period: 'mid_1980s_to_~1989',
    ended_when: 'joao_grande_moved_to_nyc_1990'
  }
]
```

**Unique pattern**: Student reviving teacher's career, teacher helping student's revival mission

### 7. Spawned Major International Organization

**ICAF emerged from GCAP**:

```typescript
institutional_relationships: {
  relationship_type: 'spawned_organization_after_split',
  parent: uuid,                               // GCAP
  child: uuid,                                // ICAF

  split_event: {
    year: 1996,
    reason: 'difference_over_direction',
    leadership_conflict: true,
    departing_leader: uuid,                   // Cobra Mansa
    other_departures: [uuid, uuid],           // Jurandir, Valmir
    amicable: 'unclear',

    child_founding: {
      name: 'International Capoeira Angola Foundation',
      location: 'Washington DC',
      mission: 'international_angola_preservation',
      scale: 'US_Brazil_Europe_Asia_Africa'
    }
  },

  pattern_similar_to: 'Senzala → Capoeira Brasil blessed split',
  difference: 'GCAP split appears less amicable'
}
```

**Shows**: Successful groups may spawn new organizations through ideological/leadership splits

### 8. Political/Cultural Resistance Founding

**Founded to resist government persecution**:

```typescript
groups: {

    chosen_before_salvador_move: true,
    symbolic: 'connection_to_historic_slave_market_site'
  }
}
```

**Political dimension**: Founded as cultural resistance movement, not just training organization

### 9. Geographic Division with Autonomy

## Unknown / Unclear Aspects

**Questions requiring further research**:

1. What is the current relationship between GCAP and the Rio de Janeiro co-founders (Braga, Neco, Zé Carlos)?
2. Are Braga, Neco, and Zé Carlos still active in Rio? Do they still use GCAP name?
3. What is the current relationship between GCAP and CECA at Forte Santo Antônio?
4. Do the two groups share resources, students, events at the fort?
5. What is the relationship between GCAP and ICAF today after the 1996 split?
6. Have Moraes and Cobra Mansa reconciled?
7. What are the specific locations in Ceará and Rio Grande do Sul mentioned?
8. How many total students has GCAP trained since 1980?
9. Are there other titled mestres or contra-mestres not documented here?
10. What is GCAP's financial model (tuition, donations, grants)?
11. How are new coordinators selected for international nuclei?
12. What happened to Marco Aurélio (mentioned as trained by Moraes in Rio)?
13. Does GCAP have formal graduation/title-granting ceremonies like the 1978 event?
14. What is GCAP's governance structure (board, council, single leader)?
15. How did the 2006 fort renovation affect GCAP's operations?

## Notes for Database Implementation

**Unique characteristics requiring schema consideration**:

1. ✅ **Four co-founder collective model** with later geographic division
2. ✅ **Formal title-granting ceremony** documented (Dec 16, 1978, Parque Lage)
3. ✅ **Revival/resurrection mission** - founded to save dying tradition
4. ✅ **Scholar-practitioner leader** - Master's, Doctorate, Professor, Grammy nomination
5. ✅ **Shared historic location** with another major group (CECA)
6. ✅ **Teacher-student-teacher cycle** - student revived teacher's career
7. ✅ **Spawned major organization** after split (ICAF 1996)
8. ✅ **Political/cultural resistance founding** - fight government persecution
9. ✅ **Geographic division with autonomy** - Rio/Salvador split, both continue
10. ✅ **Second-generation revival leaders** - Gen 2 leading revival while Gen 1 retired
11. ✅ **International nuclei coordination** - local coordinators, not hierarchical branches
12. ✅ **Orientation relationship** - groups receive orientation without being official branches (NBDA)

**Relationship types to support**:
- `co_founder`: Four co-founders of GCAP (Moraes, Braga, Neco, Zé Carlos)
- `title_granted_by`: Moraes granted mestre to Braga, Neco, Zé Carlos (1978)
- `geographic_division_with_autonomy`: GCAP Rio ↔ GCAP Salvador (1982)
- `convinced_return_from_retirement`: Moraes + Cobra Mansa → João Grande (mid-1980s)
- `taught_temporarily_for`: João Grande → GCAP (mid-1980s to ~1989)
- `spawned_after_split`: GCAP → ICAF (1996, leadership conflict)
- `coordinates_nucleus`: Mestre Kenji coordinates GCAP Japão
- `receives_orientation_from`: NBDA ← Mestre Moraes (not official branch)
- `shared_historic_location`: GCAP + CECA at Forte Santo Antônio

**Group characteristics**:
- Founding purpose: "Revival of nearly extinct Angola tradition"
- Title: "O Ressuscitador da Tradição" (The Resuscitator of Tradition)
- Founded: 1980 Rio de Janeiro, moved Salvador 1982
- Co-founders: 4 mestres (collective leadership)
- Political context: Resist government persecution of African culture
- Location: Forte Santo Antônio Além do Carmo (Forte da Capoeira)
- Shared location: With CECA (two schools at historic fort)
- Achievement: Successfully revived Angola in 1980s
- Philosophy: African roots preservation, anti-commercialization
- Cultural outreach: Children + international students
- Academic approach: Research, documentation, scholarly validation

**Person characteristics** (Mestre Moraes):
- Born: Feb 9, 1950, Ilha de Maré, Salvador
- Generation: 2 from Pastinha (student of João Grande/João Pequeno)
- Academic: Master's (Social History) + Doctorate (Culture & Society) + Professor
- Grammy: Nomination 1984 ("Roda de Capoeira" album)
- Title granted: Braga, Neco, Zé Carlos (Dec 16, 1978, Parque Lage)
- Founded: GCAP (1980 Rio, 1982 Salvador)
- Revived: João Grande's teaching career (mid-1980s)
- Current: Oversees GCAP, teaches public school Salvador

**This case study reveals**:
- How second-generation practitioners can lead revivals when tradition endangered
- Collective co-founder models with later geographic autonomy
- Political/cultural resistance as founding motivation
- Academic validation of traditional practice
- Student-teacher role reversals (student reviving teacher's career)
- Shared historic spaces between related groups
- Spawning of major organizations through ideological splits
- International nuclei with local coordinators model

**Critical for genealogy tree**: GCAP represents the revival node - the institution that "resuscitated" Capoeira Angola in 1980s when it was nearly extinct, bridging between first-generation masters (Pastinha, João Grande, João Pequeno) and modern international Angola movement.
