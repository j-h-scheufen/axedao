## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This case study is based on limited publicly available information as of January 2025 and represents a snapshot of one organization's structure and history. It is not intended to be comprehensive or representative of all Capoeira groups, nor does it claim to capture the full complexity of this group's evolution. Information about founding dates, relationships, and organizational structure is incomplete and subject to community verification. This research is preliminary and intended to inform data model design for a genealogy database. Any corrections or additional information from community members are welcome.

**Note on documentation limitations**: Escravos Brancos represents a common pattern in Brazilian capoeira - groups with significant regional/local impact but minimal online presence. This case study documents what is available while noting substantial gaps in publicly accessible information.

## 4. Federação Piauiense de Capoeira (FPC)

### Founding (1977)

**Founder**: Mestre Albino
**Model**: Imported from São Paulo Capoeira Federation
**Purpose**: Unite capoeiristas in Piauí under shared principles

**Founding principles:**
- Graduation system (cord/belt rankings)
- Rules for sporting competitions
- Standardized approach following São Paulo model

### Membership & Opposition

**Initial membership:**
- Only graduates of Escravos Brancos became FPC members
- Exclusive relationship between group and federation initially

**Opposition from Senzala/Abadá lineage:**
- Mestres affiliated with Senzala Group opposed FPC founding principles
- Key objection: Graduation system and sporting competition rules
- Representatives: Mestres Bobby, Chocolate, Tucano, John Grandão (Senzala Piauí → Abadá Piauí)
- Founded competing **Federação de Capoeira Piauiense (FECAPI)** in response

### Political Dimensions

**Two competing federations:**
1. **FPC** (Federação Piauiense de Capoeira) - Mestre Albino, Escravos Brancos lineage, São Paulo model
2. **FECAPI** (Federação de Capoeira Piauiense) - Senzala/Abadá lineage, Mestre Camisa connection

**Conflict areas:**
- Graduation systems
- Sporting competition rules
- Organizational authority
- Lineage politics (São Paulo vs. Rio traditions)

**Current status**: Unknown whether federations still operate, merged, or resolved differences

---

## 5. Geographic Presence: Piauí State

### Confirmed Location

**Primary location:**
- **City**: Teresina (capital of Piauí state)
- **Neighborhood**: Primavera, zona norte (north zone)
- **Venue**: Centro Social Urbano da Primavera (CSU Primavera) - original location (1977)
- **Current address**: Rua 19 de Novembro, Primavera, Teresina - PI, CEP: 64000970

**Additional locations:**
- Dirceu neighborhood, Teresina (2022 event held here)

### State-Level Presence

**Piauí state only**: No evidence of locations outside Piauí in available sources

**Capital-focused**: All documented activity in Teresina (state capital)

### Brazil-Only Pattern

**No international presence**: No evidence of international locations or branches

**No national expansion beyond Piauí**: Unlike major groups (ABADÁ, CDO, Muzenza, Candeias, etc.), Escravos Brancos appears to have remained regional

**Significance**: Represents common "local/regional group" pattern - significant impact within state/region but no expansion beyond

## 11. Comparison: Regional vs. International Groups

### Escravos Brancos vs. Major International Groups

| Dimension | Escravos Brancos | ABADÁ | CDO | Candeias |
|-----------|------------------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Founded** | 1977 | 1988 | 1966 | 1977 |
| **Age** | 48 years | 37 years | 59 years | 48 years |
| **Geographic scope** | 1 state (Piauí) | 60+ countries | ~30 countries | 13 states + 17 countries |
| **Scale** | City-level (Teresina) | 70,000+ students | Unknown | 10,000+ students |
| **Online presence** | Minimal/none | Extensive | Extensive | Moderate |
| **Organizational model** | Regional federation founder | Decentralized legal entities | Trademark/certification | Headquarters-centric network |
| **Expansion strategy** | None (stayed local) | Global brand | Licensing/certification | Competitive success |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Comprehensive | Comprehensive | Good |
| **Federation founding** | Yes (FPC, 1977) | No | No | No |

### Pattern Insights

**Similar age, vastly different reach:**
- Escravos Brancos (1977) and Candeias (1977) - same founding year
- 48 years later: Escravos Brancos in 1 city vs. Candeias in 13 states + 17 countries
- Age alone doesn't predict expansion

**Expansion factors:**
- Competitive success (Candeias: 6 JEBS championships)
- Systematization & pedagogy (CDO, ABADÁ)
- Founder charisma/connections
- Economic resources
- Digital presence

**Regional groups are the majority:**
- Well-documented groups (ABADÁ, CDO, Muzenza) are exceptional outliers
- Most groups likely follow Escravos Brancos pattern: regional/local, minimal documentation
- Database must account for this "silent majority"

## 14. Key Takeaway

**Escravos Brancos represents the "invisible majority" pattern in capoeira - regional/local groups with significant impact within their communities but minimal documentation and no expansion beyond their founding region.**

### What Makes This Group Unique

1. **Regional federation founder**: Founded Federação Piauiense de Capoeira (1977), establishing organizational infrastructure for Piauí state

2. **Migration-based knowledge transfer**: Founder migrated São Paulo for work (typical Nordestino pattern), learned capoeira, returned home with knowledge - circular migration as cultural transmission mechanism

3. **48+ years without expansion**: Despite founding year (1977) matching international groups like Candeias, remained city/state-level

4. **Competing federations conflict**: FPC vs. FECAPI schism represents lineage politics (São Paulo vs. Rio traditions) playing out at regional level

5. **Minimal documentation despite significance**: Active for 48 years, founded state federation, but has minimal online presence - challenges for genealogy research

6. **Brazil-only, state-level group**: No international presence, represents vast majority of capoeira groups (vs. mega-networks like ABADÁ, CDO)

### Data Model Significance

This case study reveals critical patterns:

**Migration & Cultural Transfer:**
- Economic migration (Nordeste → Southeast) repurposed for cultural learning
- Return migration brings knowledge back to origin region
- "Circular migration cultural transfer" pattern

**Regional Impact Without Expansion:**
- Groups can be locally/regionally significant without national/international reach
- Expansion is not inevitable or necessary for impact
- Database must capture regional importance even without geographic spread

**Documentation Challenges:**
- Significance ≠ documentation
- Active ≠ online presence
- Longevity ≠ information availability
- Community contribution essential for "silent majority" groups

**Organizational Model Diversity:**
- Federation founding groups (creating infrastructure)
- Regional organizations vs. international networks
- Competing federations within same region
- Need for `opposed_by` relationship type

### Comparison: Escravos Brancos vs. Database Coverage So Far

| Pattern | Escravos Brancos | Previous Case Studies |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Geographic scope** | City/state only | International (most) |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Comprehensive |
| **Online presence** | None/minimal | Extensive |
| **Organizational model** | Regional federation | Various (trademark, autonomous, hierarchical) |
| **Student count** | Unknown (likely hundreds over 48 years) | Thousands to tens of thousands |
| **Lineage documentation** | Incomplete | Well-documented |

**For the database:** Escravos Brancos validates that our schema must accommodate groups with:
- Minimal available data (many empty/unknown fields)
- Regional-only presence
- Federation relationships
- Competing organization relationships
- Migration-based founding patterns
- Documentation quality flags
- Community verification needs

**Critical insight:** The well-documented international mega-networks (ABADÁ, CDO, Muzenza, Candeias) studied so far are **exceptional outliers**. Groups like Escravos Brancos - regional, minimally documented, community-focused - likely represent the majority of capoeira groups globally. The database must be designed to handle both extremes.
