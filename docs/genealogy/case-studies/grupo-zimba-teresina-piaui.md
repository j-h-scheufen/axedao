## 8. Organizational Model: Autonomous Núcleo Network

### Core Philosophy

**Núcleo model**: Semi-autonomous branches operating under shared name and lineage

**Key characteristics:**
1. Each núcleo has local coordinator/leader
2. Mestre Boca do Rio provides supervision (from Spain)
3. Shared identity (Zimba name, Pastinha lineage, Angola purity)
4. Operational independence (local classes, events, fees)
5. No central franchise fees or licensing (based on available info)

### Contrast with Other Models

| Dimension | Grupo Zimba | GCAP (Parent) | Ngoma | ABADÁ |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| **Founding model** | Blessed departure from GCAP | Original Angola revival | Autonomous continuation | Brothers co-founding |
| **Organizational structure** | Núcleo network | Single organization | Autonomous students | Decentralized legal entities |
| **Geographic scope** | 8+ locations, 3 continents | Primarily Salvador | ~10 countries | 60+ countries |
| **Central control** | Supervision from Mestre | Direct leadership | None (voluntary) | Minimal (shared brand) |
| **Expansion method** | Núcleo establishment | Limited expansion | Student migration | Global brand |
| **Legal structure** | Filiais of Salvador HQ | Single entity | Independent groups | Independent legal entities |
| **Style purity** | Strict Angola | Strict Angola | Strict Angola | Contemporânea blend |

### Governance

**Central coordination**: Mestre Boca do Rio (from Spain)

**Local governance**: Each núcleo coordinator makes operational decisions

**Hierarchy**:
- Mestre Boca do Rio (founder, supervisor)
- Núcleo coordinators (varying ranks)
- Local instructors
- Students

**Decision-making**: Appears decentralized (núcleos manage themselves within Angola tradition framework)

---

## 9. Cultural Practices & Philosophy

### Style

**Capoeira Angola** (traditional style)

**Characteristics:**
- Slow, strategic, close-to-ground movements
- Emphasis on malícia (trickery, deception)
- Musical mastery required (berimbau, pandeiro, atabaque, agogô)
- Ritual importance (roda ceremonies, ladainha songs)
- Philosophy and wisdom alongside physical skill

**Lineage purity**: Direct Mestre Pastinha tradition via GCAP

### Mestre Pastinha Legacy

**Philosophy inherited from Pastinha:**
- Capoeira as art form, not sport
- Music, ritual, and philosophy integral (not just physical)
- African cultural heritage preservation
- Malícia (trickery/wisdom) over brute force
- Respect for elders and tradition
- "Capoeira é mandinga de escravo em ânsia de liberdade" (Capoeira is the enchantment of an enslaved person yearning for freedom)

**GCAP mission**: Transmit and preserve Pastinha's teachings
**Zimba mission**: Continues GCAP's preservation mission independently

### African Identity

**Name choice**: "Zimba" (African language, "Supreme God")
**Visual identity**: GCAP logo featured zebras (African origins)
**Cultural connection**: Emphasizes African roots of capoeira (vs. Brazilian nationalism)

**Porto Alegre núcleo statement**: "Only group representing Mestre Pastinha lineage and philosophy in Porto Alegre/RS"
- Suggests pride in lineage purity
- Distinguishes from Regional or mixed-style groups

### Academic Integration (Teresina Núcleo)

**Unique aspect**: Celso de Brito is university professor (Social Anthropology)

**Academic contributions:**
- Research on capoeira politics in Teresina
- Published articles on lineages, federations
- Integration of academic rigor with traditional practice

**Significance**: Bridges traditional oral transmission with academic documentation/analysis

2. Remote coordination from Europe (rare for Brazilian group)
3. Second-generation GCAP lineage (Moraes trained Boca do Rio, who founded Zimba)
4. Academic integration (Teresina núcleo)
5. Small-scale, selective expansion (8 núcleos in 27 years)

**Angola tradition patterns:**
- Blessed departures common (students founding own groups after graduation)
- Lineage purity emphasized (Pastinha connection crucial)
- Smaller scale than Regional/Contemporânea groups (Angola groups typically 10-100x smaller than ABADÁ, CDO)
- Music and philosophy essential (not just physical)

## 15. Key Takeaway

**Grupo de Capoeira Angola Zimba - Núcleo Teresina represents a "second-generation Angola lineage micro-núcleo with academic integration" - a small-scale, recently established (2018) branch of an international Angola network, led by a university professor, maintaining strict Mestre Pastinha lineage purity while operating within an academic community context.**

### What Makes This Group/Núcleo Unique

1. **Second-generation GCAP lineage**: Pastinha → Moraes → Boca do Rio → Zimba → Teresina - four degrees of separation from legendary founder

2. **Remote founder coordination**: Mestre Boca do Rio lives in Spain (since 2007) and coordinates international network from abroad - rare for Brazilian capoeira group

3. **Blessed departure model**: Mestre Boca do Rio graduated from GCAP (1996), left shortly after with blessing, founded Zimba (1998) - exemplifies traditional Angola succession pattern

4. **Academic integration**: Teresina núcleo led by PhD professor (Social Anthropology) - bridges traditional oral transmission with scholarly documentation

5. **Micro-scale núcleo**: Only 7 years old (2018), very small (1 professor, no advanced students listed in IPHAN), but connected to international network

6. **IPHAN filial structure**: Registered as "filial" of Salvador headquarters - formal parent-child relationship documented in official registry

7. **Angola purity in Regional-dominated region**: Teresina capoeira scene dominated by Regional/São Paulo tradition (Escravos Brancos, FPC) - Zimba brings strict Angola alternative

### Data Model Significance

This case study reveals critical patterns:

**Blessed Departure After Graduation:**
- Traditional Angola pattern: graduate achieves rank, leaves with blessing, founds own group
- Differs from hostile splits or franchise departures
- Peer recognition model: Mestre title granted by former classmate (Cobra Mansa), not teacher
- Maintains respectful relationship with parent organization

**Remote Coordination from Abroad:**
- Founder lives in Europe, coordinates Brazilian/international network remotely
- Modern technology enables diaspora founder model
- Núcleos operate day-to-day autonomously, maintain identity through lineage/philosophy
- Challenges traditional assumption that founder must be physically present

**Academic-Integrated Núcleo:**
- University professor leads capoeira group
- Research contributions alongside practice
- Scholarly approach to oral tradition
- Small scale but high legitimacy through academic credentials

**Núcleo Network vs. Branch Hierarchy:**
- IPHAN documents as "filial" (branch), but operates semi-autonomously
- Not franchise (no fees/licensing documented)
- Not fully independent (shares Zimba name, Boca do Rio supervision)
- "Núcleo" term suggests semi-autonomous unit within network

**Micro-Scale Significance:**
- Only 7 years old, very small, minimal online presence
- BUT: Connected to international network, registered with IPHAN, led by PhD professor
- Demonstrates that scale ≠ legitimacy or significance
- Database must capture both mega-networks and micro-núcleos

### Comparison: Teresina Núcleo vs. Database Coverage

| Pattern | Zimba Teresina | Previous Case Studies |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Age** | 7 years (very recent) | 25-50+ years (most) |
| **Scale** | Micro (likely <20 students) | Small to massive (hundreds to 70,000+) |
| **Leadership** | Academic (PhD professor) | Professional capoeiristas |
| **Founding** | Branch of existing network | Independent or split foundings |
| **Parent relationship** | Formal filial (IPHAN documented) | Various (autonomous, hierarchical, etc.) |
| **Founder presence** | Remote (Mestre in Spain) | Usually present or deceased |
| **Documentation** | Minimal (1 academic article, IPHAN, social media) | Comprehensive to minimal |

**For the database:** Zimba Teresina validates that our schema must accommodate:
- **Very recent groups** (2010s foundings, not just historical groups)
- **Micro-scale núcleos** (under 20 students)
- **Academic leadership** (PhD professors, researchers)
- **Remote founder coordination** (founder_location ≠ headquarters_location)
- **Formal parent-child relationships** (IPHAN filial structure)
- **Blessed departure succession** (new relationship type)
- **Peer recognition** (Mestre title from classmate, not teacher)
- **Second/third generation lineages** (Pastinha → Moraes → Boca do Rio → Zimba)

**Critical insight:** This case study shows the **breadth of scale and age diversity** in capoeira groups - from mega-networks with 70,000 students and 60+ countries (ABADÁ) to micro-núcleos with <20 students in one city (Zimba Teresina), from 59-year-old groups (CDO, 1966) to 7-year-old núcleos (Zimba Teresina, 2018). The database must capture this entire spectrum to be representative of the actual capoeira landscape.
