**Founded**: 2015 (Kenya) | Parent organization: 1990 (New York)
**Founder**: Contra-Mestre Salim Rollins | Parent founder: Mestre João Grande
**Style**: Capoeira Angola (traditional style)

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This case study focuses on **Capoeira Angola Center Kibera (CACK)**, the first African branch of Mestre João Grande's Capoeira Angola Center. The research documents:
1. The founding of the first East African Capoeira Angola center (2015)
2. The lineage connection through Mestre João Grande (direct student of Mestre Pastinha)
3. The unique pattern of capoeira operating as youth empowerment in extreme poverty
4. The historic 2017 festival bringing João Grande back to Africa after 51 years

**Not representative**: This case study focuses specifically on the Kibera location and its role in "bringing capoeira home to Africa," not Mestre João Grande's entire global network.

**Preliminary research**: Community verification welcome for Salim's biographical details and current operational status.

**Cultural Significance**: This school represents a profound "reverse diaspora" pattern - an art form created by enslaved Africans in Brazil returning to the ancestral continent through traditional lineage transmission.

## Organizational Model: NGO Multi-Pillar Youth Empowerment

### Core Philosophy

**CACK operates as ONE PROGRAM within larger NGO ecosystem**:

```
Inuka Cultural Center (Umbrella NGO)
├─ Slum Dance Africa (Breakdancing, hip-hop)
├─ Capoeira Angola Center Kibera (Traditional Capoeira Angola) ← This case study
└─ Empowerment Program for Girls (11-18 years, reproductive health)

Shared Mission: "Aspiration, upward mobility, self-empowerment"
Shared Values: Youth development through movement arts
```

**Key Characteristics**:
1. **Social Mission Integration**: Capoeira as tool for youth empowerment, not purely athletic training
2. **Free Youth Programs**: Removes economic barrier for marginalized community
3. **Cross-Subsidization**: Adult fees (1,500 KES) fund free youth workshops
4. **Holistic Approach**: Students can participate across all three pillar programs
5. **Official Affiliate**: Maintains authentic lineage connection to João Grande

### Relationship to Parent Organization (João Grande)

**Official Affiliate Status**:
- Listed as affiliate academy on João Grande's network
- Direct lineage authentication through Salim's 20+ years training
- 2017 festival validated by João Grande's personal visit

**Autonomy Level**:
- **High local autonomy**: Salim makes day-to-day decisions
- **Curriculum consistency**: Maintains traditional Angola style and philosophy
- **Cultural adaptation**: Translates Portuguese elements to Kenyan context (English/Swahili explanations)
- **No apparent licensing fees**: Operates as NGO, not commercial franchise

**Communication & Knowledge Transfer**:
- Salim likely maintains regular contact with João Grande
- Participates in international capoeira gatherings
- 2017 festival brought global community to Kenya for knowledge exchange

### Funding Model

**Revenue Sources**:
1. Adult class fees (1,500 KES twice weekly)
2. Community donations (local and international)
3. Local business partnerships (HealthyU, Kili Natural, etc.)
4. International fundraising (Indiegogo campaigns)
5. Inuka Cultural Center shared fundraising

**Expenses**:
- Instructor compensation
- Facility rental (church hall)
- Equipment (berimbaus, atabaques, pandeiros, etc.)
- Sponsored participation (free youth programs, festival attendance)
- Program materials and outreach

**Sustainability Challenge**: Dependence on donations and limited revenue from low-income community

### Contrast with Other Models

| Aspect | CACK (Kibera) | Typical Affiliate Academy | Commercial Academy |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Legal Structure** | Part of multi-program NGO | Standalone capoeira org | For-profit or single-focus nonprofit |
| **Mission** | Youth empowerment + capoeira | Capoeira instruction | Capoeira instruction |
| **Pricing** | Free for youth, subsidized adult | Standard tuition | Market-rate tuition |
| **Community** | Extreme poverty slum | Varied | Middle-class neighborhoods |
| **Programs** | Integrated with dance, girls empowerment | Capoeira only | Capoeira, maybe fitness |
| **Lineage Connection** | Official affiliate | Official affiliate | May or may not have formal affiliation |
| **Instructor Background** | Multi-disciplinary (capoeira + yoga + events) | Focused capoeirista | Focused capoeirista |

## Cultural Practices & Philosophy

### Style: Traditional Capoeira Angola

6. **History**: Origins in Angola/Congo, slavery, resistance, UNESCO recognition

- Adaptation to Kenyan context: English/Swahili instruction, cultural translation

- Improvised spaces and equipment (resource constraints)
- Ritual importance: "Creating an energy within that circle"

**Cultural Translation**:
- Portuguese songs preserved, but explained in English/Swahili

- African heritage pride emphasized strongly

### Social Mission & Philosophy

**"Bringing Capoeira Home to Africa"**:

**Research Evidence**:

### Schema Considerations

**New Relationship Types**:
- `master_historic_return`: João Grande returning to Africa after 51 years
- `student_brings_master_back`: Salim bringing João Grande to Kenya
- `multi_program_integration`: Capoeira within larger NGO ecosystem
- `cross_subsidization`: Adult fees funding free youth programs

**New Fields Needed**:
- `operates_in_extreme_poverty`: boolean flag for slum/informal settlement locations
- `social_mission_type`: enum including 'youth_empowerment', 'trauma_intervention', etc.
- `free_program_offered`: boolean
- `pricing_model`: 'free', 'donation', 'fixed_fee', 'sliding_scale', 'cross_subsidized'
- `multi_disciplinary_instructor`: array of instructor's other disciplines
- `festival_historic_significance`: tracking major symbolic events

**New Tables Needed**:
- `social_impact_testimonials`: Capture student quotes and documented outcomes
- `historic_events`: Track festivals, master visits, symbolic milestones
- `multi_program_organizations`: Model umbrella NGOs with multiple programs
