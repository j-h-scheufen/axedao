**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Original Founding**: 1941 (by Mestre Pastinha)
**Re-founded**: 1982 (by Mestre João Pequeno)
**Current Leadership**: Mestre Faísca (since 2011)

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE group out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect only CECA/Academia João Pequeno de Pastinha's specific structure and history. Other groups may have completely different organizational models.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**Historical Significance**: This case study is **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT** because CECA is **THE ORIGINAL** Capoeira Angola institution, founded by Mestre Pastinha himself in 1941. It represents the foundational institution and direct continuity of the Angola tradition from 1941 to present day.

## Founding History - The Original Angola Institution

### The Original CECA (1941)

**Founded**: February 23, 1941

**Founder**: Mestre Pastinha (Vicente Ferreira Pastinha, 1889-1981)

**Original Location**: Gengibirra neighborhood at the end of Liberdade, Salvador, Bahia

**Later Location**: 1955 - moved to Largo do Pelourinho, #19, Salvador

**Significance**: **First official Capoeira Angola school** in history

### The Founding Story (1941)

In 1941, old capoeira Angola mestres who ran the first capoeira Angola center recognized a capable person in Pastinha and entrusted him with managing the center in Liberdade.

**According to Pastinha's own account**:
- **Amorzinho** (owner of the capoeira group): "I've wanted to pass on this capoeira for you to teach for quite some time"
- **Antonio Maré**: insisted "you are the one who will be in charge of this"

**Mestre Pastinha's Mission**: Dedicated his school to preserving and continuing the long tradition of African martial art, teaching Capoeira Angola as a path of self-knowledge and mastery.

**Iconic Colors**: Pastinha adopted the colors of his favorite soccer club, Ypiranga - **yellow and black** - which became the hallmarks of the Angola style he taught.

## Data Model Insights

### 1. The Original Institution - Founded by Legendary Master

**Critical Pattern**: THE original, foundational institution

```typescript
groups: {
  group_name: 'Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola (CECA)',
  founding_type: 'original_institution_by_legend',
  founded_by_legend: true,
  founded_year: 1941,
  founder_id: uuid,                       // Mestre Pastinha
  significance: 'first_official_capoeira_angola_school',
  style: 'capoeira_angola_traditional',
  is_mother_institution: true,            // Other groups emerged from here
  iconic_colors: ['yellow', 'black'],     // Ypiranga soccer club colors
  status: 'continuously_active_1941_present'
}
```

**This is different from all other groups studied**: They are branches/offshoots. CECA is THE source.

### 2. Re-founding After Founder's Death

**Pattern**: Designated student re-founds institution to preserve legacy

```typescript
group_evolution: [
  {
    phase: 'original_founding',
    year: 1941,
    leader: uuid,                         // Pastinha
    location: 'Pelourinho, Salvador',
    status: 'active'
  },
  {
    phase: 'founder_death_closure',
    year: 1981,
    event: 'Pastinha died, original location closed'
  },
  {
    phase: 're_founding_by_designated_heir',
    year: 1982,
    leader: uuid,                         // João Pequeno
    location: 'Forte Santo Antônio, Salvador',
    designation: 'before_masters_death',
    mission: 'preserve_and_continue_lineage'
  },
  {
    phase: 'second_succession',
    year: 2011,
    event: 'João Pequeno died',
    successor: uuid,                      // Mestre Faísca
    location_added: 'Vale das Pedrinhas, Salvador',
    continuity_maintained: true
  }
]
```

### 3. Four-Generation Direct African Lineage

**Unique among all groups studied**: Traces back to African-born master

```typescript
lineage_chain: [
  {
    generation: -1,
    name: 'Mestre Africano Benedito',
    birth_country: 'Angola',
    africa_native: true,                  // BORN IN AFRICA
    taught: 'Vicente (Pastinha)',
    taught_year: ~1899,                   // When Pastinha was 10
    significance: 'direct_african_origin'
  },
  {
    generation: 0,
    name: 'Mestre Pastinha',
    birth_year: 1889,
    death_year: 1981,
    learned_from: 'Mestre Africano Benedito',
    founded_ceca: 1941,
    significance: 'father_of_capoeira_angola'
  },
  {
    generation: 1,
    name: 'Mestre João Pequeno',
    birth_year: 1917,
    death_year: 2011,
    learned_from: 'Mestre Pastinha',
    refounded_ceca: 1982,
    significance: 'principal_heir_preserved_institution'
  },
  {
    generation: 2,
    name: 'Mestre Faísca',
    learned_from: 'Mestre João Pequeno',
    received_title: 'João Pequeno',
    current_leader: true,
    significance: 'current_guardian_of_tradition'
  }
]
```

**Comparison**:
- João Grande Center: 1 generation from Pastinha
- CECA: 2 generations from Pastinha, **3 generations from African-born mestre**
- Other groups: 2-5 generations from legendary mestres, no documented African-born link

### 4. Designated Succession Before Death

**Pattern**: Master designates successor BEFORE death to ensure continuity

```typescript
succession_events: [
  {
    master: uuid,                         // Pastinha
    designated_successor: uuid,           // João Pequeno
    designation_year: 'before_1981',      // Before Pastinha's death
    explicit: true,
    mission: 'continue_his_work',
    successor_actions: {
      refounded_ceca: 1982,
      preserved_name: true,
      preserved_location_symbolic: 'Forte Santo Antônio'
    }
  },
  {
    master: uuid,                         // João Pequeno
    designated_successor: uuid,           // Mestre Faísca
    designation: 'guided_to_keep_ceca_alive',
    explicit: true,
    mission: 'keep_ceca_alive_and_academy_name',
    successor_actions: {
      preserved_name: 'Academia João Pequeno de Pastinha - CECA',
      honored_master: 'chair_of_council_honor',
      fidelity_to_teachings: true
    }
  }
]
```

### 5. Council of Honor Governance Structure

**Pattern**: Formalized governance with lifetime honorary positions

```typescript
governance: {
  structure_type: 'council_of_honor_with_coordinator',
  formalized_year: 2003,
  council_of_honor: {
    positions: 'lifetime',
    chair: uuid,                          // João Pequeno (until death 2011)
    members: [
      uuid,                               // Mestre Decânio (Dr.)
      uuid                                // Mestre Jair Moura (filmmaker/writer)
    ],
    role: 'advisory_and_legitimacy'
  },
  operational_leadership: {
    title: 'General Coordinator',
    current: uuid,                        // Mestre Faísca
    role: 'day_to_day_operations_and_expansion'
  }
}
```

**This differs from other groups**: Most have single mestre or collaborative leadership. CECA has honorific council + operational coordinator.

### 6. Mother Institution Pattern

**Pattern**: Original institution that spawned multiple other groups

```typescript
institutional_relationships: {
  relationship_type: 'mother_institution',
  original_group: uuid,                   // CECA/Pastinha's academy

  students_who_founded_groups: [
    {
      student: uuid,                      // João Grande
      founded: uuid,                      // Capoeira Angola Center (NYC, 1990)
      location: 'USA',
      connection_maintained: true
    },
    {
      student: uuid,                      // João Pequeno
      founded: uuid,                      // CECA re-founding (1982)
      location: 'Brazil',
      connection: 'direct_continuation'
    },
    {
      student: uuid,                      // Mestre Moraes
      founded: uuid,                      // GCAP (1980)
      location: 'Brazil',
      learned_from_both: [joão_grande, joão_pequeno]
    },
    {
      student: uuid,                      // Mestre Curió
      founded: uuid,                      // Escola de Capoeira Angola Irmãos Gemeos
      location: 'Brazil',
      connection: 'pastinha_student'
    },
    {
      indirect_student: uuid,             // Cobra Mansa (student of Moraes)
      founded: uuid,                      // ICAF (1996)
      location: 'USA',
      generations: 2                      // 2 generations from Pastinha
    }
  ],

  total_major_groups_emerged: 5+
}
```

### 7. Peripheral Community Social Justice Model

**Pattern**: Cultural institution embedded IN peripheral community for social transformation

```typescript
social_justice_model: {
  approach: 'embedded_community_cultural_center',
  location_strategy: 'headquarters_in_target_community',
  community_context: {
    neighborhood: 'Vale das Pedrinhas',
    characteristics: ['peripheral', 'high_poverty', 'high_crime', 'state_absence'],
    occupation_period: '1950s-1960s'
  },
  duration: '30+ years',
  target_population: 'youth_from_peripheral_communities',
  programs: [
    'traditional_capoeira_angola',
    'samba_de_roda',
    'music_singing',
    'traditional_instruments',
    'technician_training',
    'multiplying_agents'
  ],
  philosophy: 'afro_brazilian_civilizing_values',
  transformation_mechanism: 'education_and_culture',
  sustainability: 'long_term_community_presence'
}
```

**Similar to**: GCAIG's peripheral Taboão da Serra model
**Different from**: Most groups serve existing students, not community transformation focus

### 8. Historic Fort as Cultural Center

**Pattern**: Repurposing military/historic structures for capoeira preservation

```typescript
location_significance: {
  location_type: 'historic_military_fort_repurposed',
  name: 'Forte Santo Antônio Além do Carmo',
  original_use: 'military_fortress',
  construction_period: '17th_century',

  transformation: {
    new_use: 'cultural_center',

    activities: [
      'capoeira_rodas',
      'cultural_events',
      'classes'
    ]
  },
  cultural_impact: {
    international_recognition: true,
    pilgrimage_site: true,
    visitors: 'capoeiristas_worldwide',

    new_name: 'Centro de Capoeira Angola João Pequeno de Pastinha',
    significance: 'new_base_of_resistance_angola_emerged_to_world'
  }
}
```

### 9. Two-Branch Evolution Under Single Leadership

**Pattern**: Leader expands work while maintaining original location

```typescript
location_evolution: {
  leader: uuid,                           // Mestre Faísca
  integration_to_original: {
    year: 1996,

    organization_name: 'CEDANZE',
    relationship_to_original: 'expansion_not_replacement'
  },
  dual_legacy: {
    historic_location: 'Forte Santo Antônio',
    status: 'continued_for_cultural_events',
    community_location: 'Vale das Pedrinhas',
    status: 'headquarters_social_programs'
  }
}
```

### 10. International Expansion Through Representatives

**Pattern**: Coordinator appoints representatives in target countries

```typescript
expansion_model: {
  model_type: 'representative_network',
  coordinator: uuid,                      // Mestre Faísca

**Person characteristics**:

**Mestre Africano Benedito**:
- Born in: Angola, Africa
- Significance: Direct African origin of this lineage
- Taught: Mestre Pastinha (age 10, ~1899)

**Mestre Pastinha**:
- Lifespan: 1889-1981 (92 years)
- Founded: CECA 1941 (first official Angola school)
- Significance: "Father of Capoeira Angola"
- International: Senegal 1966 (First World Festival of Black Arts)
- Later years: Became blind, students ran academy

**Mestre João Pequeno**:
- Lifespan: 1917-2011 (93 years)
- Generation: 1 from Pastinha
- Designated: By Pastinha before death
- Re-founded: CECA 1982 at Forte Santo Antônio
- Recognition: Two honorary doctorates
- Taught: Until age 93

**Mestre Faísca**:
- Generation: 2 from Pastinha

- Created: CEDANZE (1989 origins, 2003 formalized)
- Current: Coordinator of international network
- Innovation: Refined pedagogy for inclusion while preserving tradition

**This case study reveals**:
- CECA is THE foundational Angola institution (all others trace lineage here)
- Direct African lineage (Benedito from Angola → Pastinha → João Pequeno → Faísca)
- Designated succession preserved continuity across 84 years
- Mother institution model (spawned multiple major Angola groups)
- Social justice through embedded community cultural centers
- Council of Honor governance for legitimacy + operational coordinator
- Re-founding pattern when founder dies (designated heir preserves legacy)
- Historic preservation (repurposing 17th-century fort for capoeira)
- Representative network expansion (maintaining fidelity to teachings)

**Critical for genealogy tree**: CECA/Pastinha's academy is the **root node** for virtually all Capoeira Angola lineages. All Angola groups ultimately trace back through here to Pastinha, and through Pastinha to Mestre Africano Benedito from Angola, Africa.
