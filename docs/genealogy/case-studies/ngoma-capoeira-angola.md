---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE group out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect a traditional Angola school with teacher-student loyalty model. This is fundamentally different from the large international networks previously studied. Many other organizational models exist.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information from web searches, social media, and public websites. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**Personal Connection**: This case study benefits from user's direct experience training with this group (Rio 2004, Berlin 2025).

## Organizational Model: Autonomous Continuation

### Core Philosophy

**"Autonomous Continuation" Pattern**:
1. Student trains intensively with Mestre Marrom in Rio (often for years, sometimes 15+)
2. Student reaches advanced rank (Contra-Mestre, Treinel)
3. Student moves to new location (home country or elsewhere)
4. Student establishes local group using "Ngoma" name
5. Group operates independently but maintains cultural connection to Marrom
6. No formal licensing, certification, or fees
7. Mestre Marrom visits for workshops/events
8. Students maintain personal loyalty across decades

### Contrast with Other Models

| Model Type | Example | Characteristic |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Autonomous Continuation** | Ngoma | Personal loyalty, independent operation, voluntary connection |
| **Certified Affiliates** | Cordão de Ouro | Trademark license, annual fees, event approval required |
| **Registered Network** | Muzenza | 706 registered instructors, central registry |
| **Decentralized Legal** | ABADÁ | Independent legal entities sharing brand |
| **Branch Structure** | Axé, Capoeira Brasil | Hierarchical "arms" and branches |
| **Blessed Split** | Capoeira Brasil from Senzala | Formalized departure with elder approval |
| **Nucleus Network** | Angoleiros do Sertão | Semi-autonomous núcleos with central connection |

**Ngoma is unique**: Students are neither licensed affiliates nor organizational branches. They are autonomous teachers carrying forward what they learned, maintaining connection through respect and cultural tradition.

### Why Students Stay Connected

**User observation**: "It's very common for a student to reach a certain level, move somewhere else, and start their own group, i.e. sever the ties with the old school. Ngoma is different - students maintain the name and connection years later."

**Possible reasons** (speculation for further research):
1. Mestre Marrom's teaching quality and personal charisma
2. Angola philosophy emphasizes lineage respect
3. Co-leadership structure (Tatiana) provides different model
4. Community-focused, non-commercial approach builds loyalty
5. Social justice mission creates shared values
6. Small, intimate group creates stronger bonds
7. 30+ years of consistent teaching builds trust

---

## Cultural Practices & Philosophy

### "Compromisso" (Commitment/Responsibility)

**Core philosophy**: Ethical commitments and responsibilities extending beyond the roda into life.

**Academic research**: Subject of scholarly articles examining ethical practices of Angoleiros do Sertão (related concept in Angola tradition).

**Implications**:
- Capoeira as life commitment, not hobby
- Responsibilities to group and community
- Cultural preservation as ethical duty
- Social engagement for greater social justice

### Social Justice Focus

**Casa Ngoma** (2020):
- Social project for children and adolescents in Babilônia community
- Socio-educational activities
- Community gathering space
- Accessible, donation-based

**Association Oyà - Paris** (2018):
- **Scholarship system** for refugees, people in exile, forced travelers, precarious situations
- **Filhas de Dandara**: Afro-feminist collective
- Cultural events, workshops on rhythm and musical rituals
- Explicitly inclusive and anti-racist

**Berlin**:
- Donation-based classes (no fixed fees)
- "Active social engagement aimed at greater social justice"
- Addresses all ages and social backgrounds
- Transcends barriers through movement and music

### Women's Leadership

**Contra-Mestra Tatiana**:
- Co-founder of Ngoma school (not just student)
- Co-producer of all school projects
- Explicitly recognized for "strengthening and valuing women's leadership in Capoeira culture"

**Filhas de Dandara** (Paris):
- Afro-feminist collective hosted by Association Oyà
- Integration of feminism and Capoeira Angola

**Contra-Mestra Aleksandra Jaksic** (Serbia):
- Female contra-mestre leading in Belgrade

**Pattern**: Ngoma explicitly promotes women in leadership roles, unlike many traditional Capoeira groups.

### Favela-Based Community Integration

**Morro da Babilônia**:
- Favela in Rio de Janeiro
- Where Marrom lives and teaches (25+ years)
- Not commercial academy - integrated into community life
- Public, accessible, donation-based
- Cultural resistance in marginalized community

**Contrast**:
- Large networks: Often commercial academies in middle-class areas
- Ngoma: Grassroots, favela-based, community-focused

## Data Model Insights

### 1. Style Transition Within Lifetime

**Marrom's Journey**:
- **1970s-1990**: Capoeira Regional (Canela, Peixinho, Senzala)
- **1990-present**: Capoeira Angola (Gato Preto, Angolinha, Nô, João Grande)

**Schema need**:
```typescript
style_history: [{
  style: 'angola' | 'regional' | 'contemporânea',
  started_at: string,
  ended_at: string | null,
  primary_teacher_id: uuid,
  influences: uuid[]  // Other mestres who influenced during this period
}]

// Example for Marrom:
[
  {
    style: 'regional',
    started_at: '1970',
    ended_at: '1990',
    primary_teacher_id: 'mestre-peixinho-id',
    influences: ['mestre-canela-id']
  },
  {
    style: 'angola',

    influences: ['mestre-angolinha-id', 'mestre-no-id', 'mestre-joao-grande-id']
  }
]
```

### 2. Autonomous Continuation Relationship

**New relationship type**:
```typescript
relationship_type: 'autonomous_continuation'

// Example: CM Stéph → Ngoma Paris
{
  from_person_id: 'cm-steph-id',
  to_group_id: 'association-oya-paris-id',
  relationship_type: 'autonomous_continuation',
  context: 'Student trained 15+ years in Rio, established autonomous Paris group maintaining Ngoma connection',
  maintains_connection: true,
  is_legally_independent: true,
  uses_parent_name: true  // "Ngoma"
}
```

### 3. Co-Leadership / Co-Founder Structure

**Tatiana as co-founder**:
```typescript
group_roles: [
  {
    person_id: 'mestre-marrom-id',
    group_id: 'ngoma-rio-id',
    role: 'founder',
    role_type: 'co_founder',

    is_primary_leader: true
  },
  {
    person_id: 'contra-mestra-tatiana-id',
    group_id: 'ngoma-rio-id',
    role: 'founder',
    role_type: 'co_founder',
    started_at: '1990',  // Needs verification of exact timing
    is_co_producer: true,
    focus: 'womens_leadership'
  }
]
```

    name: 'Marrom Capoeira & Alunos',
    started_at: '1990',
    ended_at: '2018',
    name_type: 'primary'
  },
  {
    name: 'Ngoma Capoeira Angola',

    name_type: 'primary',
    change_reason: 'political_statement',
    change_context: 'Reaffirm Black and African origins of Capoeira Angola'
  }
]
```

### 5. Social Media Decentralization

```sql
CREATE TABLE group_social_media (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id uuid REFERENCES groups(id),
  location_id uuid REFERENCES locations(id),  -- Which location/nucleus
  platform varchar,
  handle varchar,
  follower_count integer,
  is_official boolean,
  is_location_specific boolean,  -- true for decentralized locations

}
```

### 7. Favela Geography & Community Type

```typescript
locations: {

  community_integration_level: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}

groups: {
  social_justice_focus: boolean,
  political_statement: boolean,
  accessibility_priority: boolean
}
```

### 8. Multiple Relationship Types to Same Person

**Marrom had different teachers for different styles**:
```typescript
person_relationships: [
  // Regional period
  {
    from_person_id: 'marrom-id',
    to_person_id: 'mestre-peixinho-id',
    relationship_type: 'student_of',
    style_context: 'regional',
    started_at: '1970',
    ended_at: '1990',
    received_rank: 'red_belt_senzala'
  },
  // Angola period
  {
    from_person_id: 'marrom-id',
    to_person_id: 'mestre-gato-preto-id',
    relationship_type: 'student_of',
    style_context: 'angola',
    is_primary: true,
    started_at: '1990',
    ended_at: null
  },
  {
    from_person_id: 'marrom-id',
    to_person_id: 'mestre-angolinha-id',
    relationship_type: 'influenced_by',
    style_context: 'angola',
    started_at: '1990',
    ended_at: null
  }
]
```

### 9. Multiple Locations in Same City with Cross-Visitation

**Berlin has TWO Ngoma locations** under different instructors with mutual access:
- **Gneisenaustraße**: Treinel Xaxado + Contra-Mestra Mel (donation basis)
- **Forum Brasil**: Mestre Forró (35-47€/month)

**Pattern**:
```typescript
cross_visitation_arrangement: {
  same_city: true,
  different_instructors: true,
  different_fee_structures: true,
  mutual_access_allowed: true,
  extra_payment_required: false,
  encouragement_level: 'encouraged',  // Students "encouraged" to visit both

  organizational_context: 'autonomous_continuation',
  // Both instructors graduated under Mestre Marrom but teach independently
  // Mestre Forró made Contra-Mestre in Rio 2004, moved to Hannover then Berlin

  locations: [
    {
      instructor_id: uuid,              // Treinel Xaxado, CM Mel
      location_id: uuid,                // Gneisenaustraße
      fee_structure: 'donation_based',
      primary_brand: 'Ngoma Capoeira Angola Berlin'
    },
    {
      instructor_id: uuid,              // Mestre Forró
      location_id: uuid,                // Forum Brasil
      fee_structure: 'fixed_monthly',   // 35-47€
      primary_brand: 'Forum Brasil / Ngoma connection',
      also_teaches_in: ['Hannover']     // Multi-city instructor
    }
  ]
}
```

**Data Model Implications**:
1. Same group can have multiple independent locations in same city
2. Each location may have different fee structures (donation vs. fixed)
3. Each location may have different branding (Ngoma Berlin vs. Forum Brasil)
4. Students may have access to multiple locations without extra fees
5. Instructors maintain connection to same mestre/lineage but operate independently

**Verification Source**: User's personal experience (trained with Ngoma Rio 2004, currently training Ngoma Berlin 2025)

## Comparison: Ngoma vs. Angoleiros do Sertão

Both Angola groups but very different organizational models:

| Aspect | Ngoma (Marrom) | Angoleiros do Sertão (Cláudio) |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Model** | Autonomous continuation | Nucleus network |
| **Structure** | Students establish own groups independently | Núcleos semi-autonomous but connected |
| **Leadership** | Co-leadership (Marrom + Tatiana) | Single mestre (Cláudio) |
| **Locations** | 15+ autonomous | 20+ núcleos |
| **Naming** | Some still use old name ("Marrom e Alunos") | All use "Angoleiros do Sertão [Location]" |
| **Student leaders** | Contra-Mestres, Treinels | Treinels, Professores |
| **Gatherings** | Visits by Marrom for workshops | Annual "Encontros" bringing núcleos together |
| **Cultural integration** | Social justice, women's leadership, scholarships | Samba Rural, strict discipline, musical excellence |
| **Geography** | Favela-based (Rio) | Public space (main avenue rodas) |
| **Political dimension** | Name change (Ngoma = African) | Geographic identity (Sertão = interior) |
| **Social media** | Decentralized, some use old names | Decentralized, consistent naming |

**Key difference**: Ngoma students are more autonomous (can even keep old name), while Angoleiros núcleos maintain tighter structural connection to headquarters.

---

## Unknown / Questions for Further Research

1. **Exact dates**: When did Marrom receive his Mestre title? Who granted it?
2. **Complete student list**: How many total students/groups worldwide?
3. **Organizational structure**: Is there any formal structure or purely personal?
4. **Name usage**: Do students need approval to use "Ngoma" name?
5. **Tatiana's timeline**: When did she become co-founder? From 1990 or later?
6. **Graduation system**: What ranks/cords exist? How are they granted?
7. **Regular events**: Are there annual gatherings like Angoleiros' "Encontros"?
8. **Mão No Chão relationship**: What is connection between Ngoma Scotland and Mão No Chão Brisbane?
9. **Dion Dragas**: Why did he rebrand from Mão No Chão to Ngoma Scotland?
10. **Casa Ngoma programs**: What specific programs run at Casa Ngoma?
11. **Financial model**: How is the Rio headquarters sustained? Donations only?
12. **Other Angola schools**: How does Ngoma relate to GCAP, FICA, other Angola organizations?

## Key Takeaway

**Ngoma represents "organic personal transmission" model**:
- Students train deeply with mestre (often 15+ years)
- Move to new locations for life reasons
- Establish autonomous groups maintaining cultural connection
- No legal/organizational structure binding them
- Personal loyalty transcends geography and decades
- Co-leadership emphasizes women's role
- Social justice and community focus over commercialization
- Political consciousness (name change, African roots, scholarships for marginalized)

**This model works because**:
1. Quality of teaching creates lasting impact
2. Angola philosophy values lineage and respect
3. Personal bonds stronger than organizational ties
4. Shared values (social justice, accessibility, anti-racism) create cohesion
5. Non-commercial approach removes conflicts over money/growth
6. Students feel ownership and autonomy, not just employees/affiliates

**Data model must capture**:
- Autonomous continuation (not branch, not split)
- Style transitions within lifetime
- Multiple teachers sequentially
- Co-leadership and women's leadership
- Political naming and social justice dimensions
- Decentralized social media with old names persisting
- Community integration (favela-based)
- Scholarship programs and social accessibility
