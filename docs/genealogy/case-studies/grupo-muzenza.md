# Case Study: Grupo Muzenza de Capoeira

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Status**: Initial Research
**Category**: Large International Network, Contemporary Style

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE group out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect only this specific large international network. Smaller groups, regional organizations, Angola-focused groups, and independent mestres may have completely different structures and practices.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**No Universal Patterns**: What appears to be a "pattern" across 4 large networks may not apply to the broader Capoeira community. Further research across diverse group types is required.

## Founding & Leadership Evolution

### Phase 1: Founding (1972)

**Mestre Paulão** (Paulo Sérgio da Silva):
- Founded Grupo Muzenza on May 5, 1972, in Rio de Janeiro
- Came from Capoarte de Obaluaê
- Trained under **Mestre Mintirinha** (Luís Américo da Silva) - his brother!
- Led the group until 1978

**Note**: Another family relationship (brothers) in Capoeira lineage.

### Phase 2: Expansion to South (1975)

**Mestre Burguês** (Antônio Carlos de Menezes):
- Moved to Curitiba, Paraná in October 1975
- Established southern branch while Paulão continued in Rio
- Taught in diverse settings: clubs, military barracks, schools, academies, underserved communities
- Massive growth in Curitiba region

### Phase 3: Leadership Transition (1978)

**Critical transition**: Mestre Burguês became president of the group in 1978
- Unclear what happened to Mestre Paulão (still involved? retired? left?)
- Burguês has been president since 1978 (47 years!)
- Group's identity strongly associated with Burguês and Curitiba base

**Questions**:
- What is Paulão's current status/relationship with the group?
- Was this an amicable transition or a split?
- Does Paulão still have recognition as founder?

### Current Leadership

**Mestre Burguês**:
- President since 1978
- Based in Curitiba, Paraná
- Known for:
  - Modernizing/stylizing Capoeira while preserving fundamentals
  - Researching traditional elements
  - Developing standardized methodology
  - International expansion (61 countries)
  - Academic/research focus

**Philosophy**: "Capoeira é capoeira, para que você possa entender melhor essa definição deve vivê-la" (Capoeira is capoeira, to truly understand this definition you must live it)

```

### Registration System

**706 registered instructors** (as of March 2020):
- Hierarchical structure: Mestres → Contra-Mestres → Teachers → Instructors
- Worldwide distribution
- Suggests formal registration/tracking system (similar to CDO)

**Questions**:
- What does "registered" mean? Is there a certification process?
- Are there fees for registration?
- Can registration be revoked?
- Is there a certificate like CDO's Alvará?

### Scale Comparison

| Metric | Muzenza | Comparison |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Countries | 61 | Larger than CDO's stated reach |
| Brazilian states | 26 | Almost all states (Brazil has 26 states + DF) |
| Registered instructors | 706 | More formalized than Axé's visible structure |
| Membership (2000) | ~25,000 | Massive scale |
| Students (Curitiba) | 20,000+ | Single city! |

**Observation**: This is one of the largest Capoeira organizations by raw numbers.

## Key Features

### 1. Standardized Methodology

**22 Choreographed Sequences**:
- Structured teaching approach
- Emphasis on speed, objectivity
- Individual player expression (not enforced uniformity)
- Allows personal style within framework

**Comparison**:
- More structured than traditional Angola approach
- Similar to other contemporary groups (Capoeira Brasil, etc.)
- Balance between standardization and creativity

### 2. Modern & Stylized Approach

**Burguês's methodology**:
- Studied capoeira fundamentals in Bahia and Rio
- Developed "modern and stylized style"
- Research into traditional elements
- Synthesized tradition with contemporary approach

**Philosophy**: Returning to foundational elements through research while modernizing presentation

### 3. Academic/Research Focus

**ENCAMUZENZA** (established 2013+):
- Multidisciplinary meetings
- Produces *Textos de Capoeira* publications
- Academic approach to Capoeira study
- Books, CDs, DVDs, journals

**Notable**: Strong emphasis on documentation and research (similar to Mestre Moraes's approach in Angola)

### 4. Standardized Elements

**Uniforms**: White trousers and T-shirts (standardized across network)

**Six basic rhythms (toques)**:
- Angola
- São Bento Pequeno
- São Bento Grande variants
- Iúna
- Banguela

**Orchestra**: Atabaque, berimbaus, tambourine, agogô, reco-reco

**Observation**: Strong standardization suggests centralized control over curriculum and identity

### 5. Website Organization

**Affiliated sites page** (https://muzenza.com.br/site/sites-muzenza/):
- **Single unstructured list** (~20+ sites)
- No geographic organization
- Mixes Brazilian states and international locations randomly
- Each entry: URL + brief label

**Examples**:
- "www.muzenza.com.br SITE OFICIAL MUZENZA"
- "CAMPEONATO EUROPEU MUZENZA"
- Regional academias: Curitiba, Maringa, São Paulo
- International: Seoul, Leon, Algarve, Blumenau
- Specialized: pedagogical capoeira, children's programs

**Observation**: Less organized than CDO's continent/country structure or Axé's location finder. Suggests decentralized web presence.

---

## Observed Patterns

### 1. Leadership Succession Model

**Founder → Successor transition**:
- Mestre Paulão founded (1972)
- Mestre Burguês expanded to Curitiba (1975)
- Burguês became president (1978)
- Transition after only 6 years

**Pattern**: Early succession/transition
- Different from founder-for-life model (Suassuna, Barrão)
- Unclear if Paulão chose to step down or was replaced
- Burguês's expansion success may have driven leadership shift

**Question**: Is this a voluntary succession or organizational split?

### 2. Geographic Center Shift

**Rio de Janeiro (origin) → Curitiba (power center)**:
- Founded in Rio (1972)
- Southern expansion to Curitiba (1975)
- Curitiba became headquarters under Burguês (1978)
- 20,000+ students through Curitiba alone

**Observation**: Geographic shift accompanied leadership shift. Unusual pattern - most groups stay centered on founder's original location.

### 3. Scale Through Standardization

**How Muzenza achieved massive scale**:
- Standardized methodology (22 sequences)
- Uniform curriculum across locations
- White uniforms (visual identity)
- Registered instructor system (706 instructors)
- Academic support (publications, training materials)

**Theory**: Standardization enables scaling
- Similar to franchise model
- Instructors can be trained in consistent methodology
- Quality control through registration system

### 4. Contemporary Style Positioning

**Blend approach**:
- Research into traditional fundamentals
- Modern/stylized presentation
- Contemporary classification
- Not purist Angola or pure Regional

**Market positioning**: Appeals to modern practitioners while respecting roots

### 5. Decentralized Web Presence

**Contrast with other large groups**:
- CDO: Organized by continent/country
- Axé: Centralized location finder
- Muzenza: Unstructured list of ~20+ independent sites

**Interpretation**:
- Local groups have autonomy to create own sites
- Less centralized digital strategy
- Each location manages own web presence

## Potential Data Model Implications

**Caveat**: Preliminary observations - need more information about Muzenza's formal structure.

### Leadership Succession Tracking

**New pattern**: Founder → Successor transition

**Observed**: Paulão (founder, 1972-1978) → Burguês (president, 1978-present)

**Possible implementation**:
```typescript
// In groups table or group_roles
// Use group_roles with temporal tracking:

// Example records:
// 1. Paulão as founder and leader (1972-1978)
{
  userId: 'paulao-id',
  groupId: 'muzenza-id',
  role: 'founder',
  startedAt: '1972-05-05',
  endedAt: null, // Never ends - always the founder
}
{
  userId: 'paulao-id',
  groupId: 'muzenza-id',
  role: 'leader',
  startedAt: '1972-05-05',
  endedAt: '1978-01-01', // Stepped down as leader
}

// 2. Burguês as president (1978-present)
{
  userId: 'burgues-id',
  groupId: 'muzenza-id',
  role: 'president', // Different from 'leader'?
  startedAt: '1978-01-01',
  endedAt: null, // Current
}
```

**Questions**:
- Should we add 'president' as distinct from 'leader'?
- How to capture "emeritus founder" status (if Paulão is still recognized)?

### Geographic Center Tracking

**New pattern**: Headquarters location shifts over time

**Observed**: Rio de Janeiro (1972-1978?) → Curitiba (1978-present)

**Possible implementation**:
```typescript
// In groups table
current_headquarters_location: varchar('current_headquarters_location'),
original_headquarters_location: varchar('original_headquarters_location'),
headquarters_changed_at: timestamp('headquarters_changed_at'),

// Or track in group history table?
// group_headquarters_history
export const groupHeadquartersHistory = pgTable('group_headquarters_history', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  groupId: uuid('group_id').references(() => groups.id).notNull(),
  location: varchar('location').notNull(),
  startedAt: timestamp('started_at').notNull(),
  endedAt: timestamp('ended_at'),
  reason: text('reason'), // Why the move?
});
```

**Use cases**:
- Show group's geographic evolution
- Important for understanding group's history
- Some groups stay put (CDO), others migrate (Muzenza, Axé to Canada)

### Registration vs. Certification

**Observed**: Muzenza has "706 registered instructors"
**Similar to**: CDO's registration + certification system

**Questions**:
- Is "registered" same as "certified"?
- Could both concepts exist? (register first, then certify?)

**Possible unified model**:
```typescript
// instructor_affiliations or group_instructor_registry
export const instructorAffiliations = pgTable('instructor_affiliations', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),

  userId: uuid('user_id').references(() => users.id).notNull(),
  groupId: uuid('group_id').references(() => groups.id).notNull(),

  // Status
  status: enum('affiliation_status', [
    'registered',    // Registered with group
    'certified',     // Certified to teach
    'suspended',     // Temporarily suspended
    'revoked',       // Registration revoked
    'expired'        // Lapsed (didn't renew)
  ]).notNull(),

  // Instructor level
  level: enum('instructor_level', [
    'instructor',
    'teacher',
    'professor',
    'contra_mestre',
    'mestre'
  ]),

  // Dates
  registeredAt: timestamp('registered_at').notNull(),
  certifiedAt: timestamp('certified_at'),
  expiresAt: timestamp('expires_at'),
  lastRenewedAt: timestamp('last_renewed_at'),

  // Metadata
  notes: text('notes'),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
});
```

### Standardized Methodology Tracking

**New concept**: Groups may have formalized teaching methodologies

**Muzenza example**: 22 choreographed sequences

**Possible implementation**:
```typescript
// In groups table
has_standardized_methodology: boolean('has_standardized_methodology').default(false),
methodology_description: text('methodology_description'),

// Or separate table for curriculum elements?
// group_curriculum
export const groupCurriculum = pgTable('group_curriculum', {
  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  groupId: uuid('group_id').references(() => groups.id).notNull(),

  element_type: enum('curriculum_element', [
    'sequence',
    'movement',
    'rhythm',
    'song',
    'philosophy'
  ]),

  name: varchar('name').notNull(),
  description: text('description'),
  order: integer('order'), // For sequences 1-22, etc.

  // Metadata
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
});
```

**Use cases**:
- Document group's teaching approach
- Help students know what to expect
- Differentiate between groups (standardized vs. traditional)

## Import Opportunities

### Website List Scraping

**URL**: https://muzenza.com.br/site/sites-muzenza/

**Structure**:
- Single unstructured list of ~20+ affiliated websites
- Each entry: URL + label
- No geographic organization

**Potential value**:
- List of Muzenza locations worldwide
- Could discover groups not yet in Quilombo
- Contact information may be on individual sites

**Challenges**:
- Not a structured directory (unlike CDO)
- Would need to scrape each individual site for details
- Sites may be outdated or inactive
- No consistency in site structure (each independently designed)

**Recommendation**: Lower priority than CDO/Axé due to less structured data

---

## Related Examples

### Comparison with CDO & Axé

**Leadership longevity**:
- **CDO**: Suassuna, 58 years (1967-present)
- **Axé**: Barrão, 43 years (1982-present)
- **Muzenza**: Paulão, 6 years (1972-1978); Burguês, 47 years (1978-present)

**Geographic shift**:
- **CDO**: Stayed in São Paulo
- **Axé**: Shifted from Recife to Canada
- **Muzenza**: Shifted from Rio to Curitiba

**Leadership model**:
- **CDO**: Founder-led, co-founders
- **Axé**: Founder-led, family succession emerging
- **Muzenza**: Successor-led after early transition

### Pattern: Early vs. Late Succession

**Early succession** (Muzenza):
- Founder leads 6 years
- Successor takes over
- Successor leads for decades (47 years so far)

**Late/family succession** (Axé):
- Founder leads for life
- Family member (son) prepared as successor
- Transition happens late in founder's life or after death

**Founder-for-life** (CDO):
- Original founder(s) lead indefinitely
- No clear succession plan (or not publicly known)

**Question**: Which model is more common? More successful?
