## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE group out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect only Cai Na Capoeira's specific structure and history. Other groups may have completely different organizational models.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**Significance**: This case study is important because it documents a **small, local/regional CDO affiliate**, contrasting with the large international networks previously studied. It shows how global organizations expand through local instructors under remote supervision.

## Data Model Insights

### 1. Small Regional Affiliate Model

**Pattern**: Instructor-led local organization under remote supervision

```typescript
groups: {
  group_type: 'local_affiliate',
  scale: 'local_regional',
  parent_organization: uuid,              // Cordão de Ouro
  supervising_mestre: uuid,               // Mestre Esquilo (Brazil)
  local_leader: uuid,                     // Contra Mestre Cabeção
  founding_type: 'diaspora_instructor_led',

  locations_count: 5,
  geographic_scope: 'single_metro_area',  // Hudson Valley
  autonomy_level: 'supervised',           // Not autonomous

  relationship_to_parent: {
    type: 'supervised_affiliate',
    supervision: 'remote_from_brazil',
    uses_parent_name: false,              // Own brand "Cai Na Capoeira"
    follows_parent_methodology: true,     // CDO style
    graduation_authority: 'supervising_mestre'
  }
}
```

**Differs from**:
- Large international networks (ABADÁ, CDO, Senzala)
- Autonomous groups (split from parent)
- Multi-location franchises

### 2. Instructor Migration Pattern

**Pattern**: Brazilian instructor moves to US, establishes affiliate

```typescript
founding_pattern: {
  pattern_type: 'instructor_migration_and_establishment',

  instructor_background: {
    trained_in: 'Brazil',
    training_location: 'Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais',
    training_start: '1996-06',
    parent_group: 'CDO (Mestre Esquilo)',
    rank_achieved: 'contra_mestre'
  },

  migration: {
    destination: 'USA',
    arrival_year: 2011,
    initial_activity: 'touring_teaching_performing',
    settled_in: 'Hudson Valley, NY',
    establishment_year: 2012
  },

  connection_maintained: {
    to_origin: true,
    supervision_by: 'original_mestre',
    remote_supervision: true,
    periodic_visits: 'likely_for_batizados'
  }
}
```

**Common pattern**: Brazilian instructors emigrating and establishing affiliates while maintaining parent organization connection

### 3. Co-Instructor Partnership

**Pattern**: Two instructors with different CDO connections collaborating

```typescript
leadership_structure: {
  model: 'co_instructor_partnership',

  primary_instructor: {
    person: uuid,                         // Cabeção
    cdo_connection: 'Mestre Esquilo',
    started_training: 1996,
    location_origin: 'Sete Lagoas, Brazil'
  },

  secondary_instructor: {
    person: uuid,                         // Instrutora Areia
    cdo_connection: 'Professora Casca Dura',
    started_cdo: 2009,
    location_origin: 'Rochester, NY',
    prior_group: 'Capoeira Mandinga Com Expressão'
  },

  partnership: {
    formed: 2011,
    collaboration_areas: [
      'co_teaching',
      'class_promotion',
      'event_organization',
      'multi_county_expansion'
    ],
    complementary: true                   // Different CDO connections, different origins
  }
}
```

**Shows**: Collaboration between instructors with different paths into CDO

### 4. Multi-Location Local Network

**Pattern**: Single organization, multiple nearby locations

```typescript
location_model: {
  model_type: 'multi_location_local_network',

  locations: [
    { city: 'Peekskill', venue: 'New Era Creative Space', distance_from_base: '10_miles' },
    { city: 'Ossining', venue: 'TBD', distance_from_base: '0_miles', first_location: true },
    { city: 'Tarrytown', venue: 'TBD', distance_from_base: '5_miles' },
    { city: 'Beacon', venue: 'TBD', distance_from_base: '20_miles' },
    { city: 'Cold Spring', venue: 'TBD', distance_from_base: '25_miles' }
  ],

  total_locations: 5,
  geographic_radius: '~25_miles',
  metro_area: 'Hudson Valley',
  expansion_strategy: 'organic_nearby_towns',

  instructor_travel: {
    single_instructor_multiple_locations: true,
    commute_pattern: 'rotating_schedule',
    community_building: 'across_small_towns'
  }
}
```

**Typical for small groups**: One instructor teaching at multiple nearby venues

### 5. Suburban/Small Town Capoeira Model

**Pattern**: Bringing capoeira to areas outside major urban centers

```typescript
community_context: {
  location_type: 'suburban_small_town',
  not_major_urban_center: true,

  towns_served: [
    { name: 'Peekskill', population: '~25k', type: 'small_city' },
    { name: 'Ossining', population: '~38k', type: 'small_city' },
    { name: 'Tarrytown', population: '~12k', type: 'village' },
    { name: 'Beacon', population: '~15k', type: 'small_city' },
    { name: 'Cold Spring', population: '~2k', type: 'village' }
  ],

  metro_relationship: 'commuter_towns_near_nyc',

  significance: {
    bringing_capoeira_to: 'underserved_areas',
    not_competing_with: 'major_nyc_groups',
    community_role: 'cultural_education_in_smaller_communities',
    accessibility: 'families_in_suburban_areas'
  }
}
```

**Differs from**: Urban groups in NYC, Boston, LA, etc.

### 6. Professional Educator Leading Group

**Pattern**: Capoeira instructor with formal physical education degree

```typescript
instructor_credentials: {
  person: uuid,                           // Contra Mestre Cabeção

  formal_education: {
    degree: 'Bachelor in Physical Education',
    institution: 'Uni-BH (Brazil)',
    relevance: 'professional_teaching_background'
  },

  capoeira_credentials: {
    rank: 'contra_mestre',
    years_experience: 25,
    training_location: 'Sete Lagoas, Brazil',
    supervising_mestre: uuid,             // Mestre Esquilo
    international_experience: ['Brazil', 'Israel', 'USA']
  },

  combined_value: {
    professional_pedagogy: true,
    traditional_capoeira: true,
    credibility: 'both_formal_and_cultural',
    teaching_quality: 'dual_expertise'
  }
}
```

**Similar to**: Mestre Moraes (GCAP - Master's + Doctorate)
**Common among**: Professional instructors running schools

### 7. Remote Supervision Model

**Pattern**: Brazil-based mestre supervising US affiliate

```typescript
supervision_model: {
  model_type: 'remote_international_supervision',

  supervisor: {
    mestre: uuid,                         // Mestre Esquilo
    location: 'Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil',
    distance: '~4700_miles_from_ny'
  },

  supervised: {
    instructor: uuid,                     // Contra Mestre Cabeção
    location: 'Hudson Valley, NY, USA',
    organization: uuid                    // Cai Na Capoeira
  },

  supervision_mechanisms: [
    'periodic_communication',
    'graduation_approvals',
    'technical_guidance',
    'batizado_visits_likely',
    'maintains_cdo_standards'
  ],

  challenges: {
    distance: 'international',
    time_zones: '1-3_hours_difference',
    in_person_contact: 'limited',
    cultural_context: 'different_country'
  },

  benefits: {
    authentic_lineage: true,
    cdo_legitimacy: true,
    brazilian_connection: true,
    access_to_wider_network: true
  }
}
```

**Enables**: Global expansion without mestre relocation

### 8. First Batizado as Formal Establishment

**Pattern**: Group exists informally, batizado marks formal establishment

```typescript
group_establishment: {
  informal_phase: {
    start: '2012-01',                     // Started teaching
    activities: [
      'classes_in_ossining',
      'expansion_to_tarrytown',
      'building_student_base'
    ],
    duration_months: 9
  },

  formal_establishment: {
    event: 'first_batizado',
    date: '2012-10',
    significance: [
      'first_cordoes_delivered',
      'students_formally_initiated',
      'group_identity_established',
      'annual_tradition_begun'
    ]
  },

  pattern_significance: {
    teaching_precedes_formalization: true,
    student_base_first: true,
    batizado_as_milestone: true,
    legitimacy_through_ceremony: true
  }
}
```

**Common pattern**: Instructors teach informally before holding first batizado to formalize group

## Notes for Database Implementation

**Unique characteristics requiring schema consideration**:

1. ✅ **Small regional affiliate model** - 5 locations, single metro area
2. ✅ **Remote international supervision** - Brazil-based mestre supervising US group
3. ✅ **Instructor migration pattern** - Brazilian instructor establishing US affiliate
4. ✅ **Co-instructor partnership** - Two instructors, different CDO connections
5. ✅ **Multi-location local network** - One organization, multiple nearby towns
6. ✅ **Suburban/small town model** - Not major urban center
7. ✅ **Professional educator leader** - Bachelor's in Physical Education + capoeira experience
8. ✅ **First batizado as formal establishment** - Teaching precedes formal group identity

**Relationship types to support**:
- `supervised_affiliate`: Cai Na Capoeira ← Mestre Esquilo (CDO)
- `trained_under`: Cabeção ← Mestre Esquilo (1996-present)
- `co_instructor`: Cabeção ↔ Instrutora Areia
- `trained_under`: Instrutora Areia ← Professora Casca Dura (CDO)
- `parent_organization`: Cai Na Capoeira ← CDO
- `remote_supervision`: Mestre Esquilo (Brazil) → Cai Na Capoeira (USA)

**Group characteristics**:
- Scale: Local/regional (5 locations, single metro area)
- Autonomy: Supervised affiliate (not autonomous)
- Founded: 2012 (recent establishment)
- Founder rank: Contra Mestre (not Mestre)
- Supervision: Remote from Brazil
- Geographic type: Suburban/small towns
- Community role: Bringing capoeira to underserved areas
- Professional credentials: Leader has formal physical education degree

**This case study reveals**:
- How large organizations (CDO) expand through individual instructors
- Remote international supervision models
- Small regional affiliate structures
- Instructor migration establishing diaspora affiliates
- Suburban/small town capoeira accessibility
- Co-instructor partnerships with different parent connections
- First batizado as formal group establishment marker

**Critical for data model**: Represents the "typical small affiliate" pattern - the most common way capoeira groups form in diaspora (instructor emigrates, establishes supervised affiliate, maintains parent organization connection). This contrasts with large autonomous networks and shows the grassroots level of capoeira expansion.
