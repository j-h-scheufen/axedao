# Case Study: Marinheiro (Russia)

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Founded**: February 23, 2009 (Moscow, Russia)
**Founder/Director**: Agata Kovaleva
**Style**: Unknown
**Scale**: Regional (Moscow metropolitan area + branches)
**Status**: Unknown (website inaccessible as of 2025)

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This case study is based on **extremely limited publicly available information**. The school's website (marinheiro.ru) is currently inaccessible, no social media presence was found, and no information about training lineage or organizational structure could be located. This case study documents:
1. What minimal information could be confirmed through WCF records and Russian Federation sources
2. The broader Russian capoeira context in which Marinheiro was founded
3. The challenge of researching smaller regional schools for genealogy tree purposes

**This case study primarily serves to illustrate the "orphaned node" problem** - schools whose lineage connections cannot be traced through available sources.

**Not representative**: This is a snapshot of one small regional school within the complex Russian capoeira landscape.

**Preliminary research**: This will require community verification and insider knowledge to complete.

## Group Evolution & Organizational History

### Founding

**Date**: February 23, 2009
**Location**: Moscow, Russia
**Context**: Founded 11 years after Russian Capoeira Federation (1998), one year after Capoeira Camara appeared in Russia (2008), during period of capoeira growth in Russia

**Significant Date**: The founding date (February 23, 2009) is exactly **3 years before** the Russian Capoeira Federation joined the World Capoeira Federation as a full member (February 23, 2012). This may be coincidental or may indicate connection to Russian Federation activities.

### Name: "Marinheiro"

**Portuguese Meaning**: "Sailor" or "Seaman"

**Cultural Context**:
- Common word in capoeira music (traditional song: "Marinheiro Só")
- Historical connection: Mestre Pastinha taught at "Companhia de Aprendizes de Marinheiro" (Company of Naval Apprentices) in 1902
- Used as apelido/nickname by capoeiristas (e.g., "Formando Marinheiro" in Grupo Capoeira Brasil Belo Horizonte)

**No evidence of connection** to Brazilian groups using similar names.

**This lack of social media presence is unusual** for a capoeira school founded in 2009, as social media was already widely adopted by then.

**Possible explanations**:
1. School may have closed or become inactive
2. School operates primarily through word-of-mouth in local Moscow community
3. Social media presence exists under different name/branding
4. School is very small-scale with limited marketing

    community_forums: boolean,
    personal_networks: boolean
  }
}
```

### Relationship Types Present

From this minimal research, we can only confirm:

```typescript
relationships_identified: {
  person_to_organization: [
    'member_of',                          // Agata → Russian Capoeira Federation
    'individual_member_of',               // Agata → WCF
    'founded'                             // Agata → Marinheiro
  ],

  organization_to_organization: [
    'member_school_of'                    // Marinheiro → Russian Capoeira Federation (inferred)
  ],

  // CANNOT determine
  person_to_person: [],                   // No teacher-student relationships known
  lineage_chain: []                       // Cannot trace lineage

## Key Takeaway

**Marinheiro represents the "orphaned node" challenge in capoeira genealogy research** - a documented school whose lineage cannot be traced through available public sources.

### For Database Design:

1. **Schema must handle incomplete data**: Nullable fields for lineage, style, current status
2. **Confidence levels needed**: Flag data as verified/unverified/unknown
3. **Community verification critical**: System needs mechanism for community members to contribute missing lineage information
4. **Third-party verification sources**: WCF registration provides minimal but valuable confirmation of existence

### For Genealogy Tree Visualization:

1. **Visual distinction needed**: "Orphaned nodes" should be visually distinct from fully-traced lineages
2. **Partial information display**: Show what IS known even when lineage unknown
3. **Contribution prompts**: Invite community to "claim" or verify these orphaned nodes
4. **Context layers**: Russian Federation membership provides organizational context even without lineage

### For Research Methodology:

1. **Document search attempts**: Record what was searched and not found (as valuable as what was found)
2. **Set realistic expectations**: Not all schools will have traceable lineages through public sources
3. **Prioritize accessibility**: Schools with accessible websites, social media, and English content are easier to research
4. **Local knowledge essential**: Small regional schools require insider/community knowledge to fully document

### Cultural Insight:

The proliferation of capoeira in Russia (Federation founded 1998, multiple large groups by 2009) created environment where **local practitioners could found schools without direct ongoing connection to Brazilian mestres**. This pattern likely exists in many countries and represents a significant portion of global capoeira schools that will be challenging to place in traditional genealogy trees.

**Question for community**: Does this represent legitimate capoeira transmission (knowledge passed through seminars, workshops, visits) or dilution of lineage? How should genealogy tree handle these cases?
