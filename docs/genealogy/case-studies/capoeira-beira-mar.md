# Case Study: Capoeira Beira-Mar (Brazil & USA)

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Founded**: 1970s-1980s (Brazil), 1990s-2000s (USA as Grupo Bantu, merged with Beira-Mar)
**Founders**:
- **Brazil**: Mestre Tarzan (Associação Desportiva e Cultural de Capoeira Beira Mar)
- **USA**: Contra-Mestre Bundo (Grupo Bantu → Bantu Beira-Mar → merged with Beira-Mar)
**Locations**: Brazil (Araçatuba, Campinas, São Paulo) & USA (Florida, Kentucky, Colorado) & South Korea (Daejeon)
**Style**: Capoeira Regional (Bimba lineage through Suassuna)
**Scale**: International (Brazil + USA + South Korea, 8+ locations)

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE organization with presence in Brazil and USA out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect only Capoeira Beira-Mar's specific structure and history. Other groups may have completely different organizational models.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**Historical Significance**: This case study is important because:
1. **Brazil-USA dual presence** - Founded in Brazil, established presence in USA
2. **Reunion/merger pattern** - USA group founded independently, later merged with Brazilian parent
3. **Regional lineage** - Direct connection to Bimba through Suassuna and Medicina
4. **US representative model** - Contra-Mestre as official representative in different country
5. **University partnerships** - Strong presence in Kentucky universities (EKU, UNF)

### Training and Lineage - Direct from Bimba through Suassuna and Medicina

**Generation Chain**:
```
Mestre Bimba (1900-1974, "Father of Capoeira Regional")
    ↓
Mestre Suassuna (co-founded Cordão de Ouro, 1967)
    ↓
Mestre Medicina (Luiz Medicina)
    ↓
Mestre Tarzan - Generation 4 from Bimba
```

**Mestre Medicina** (Luiz Medicina):
- Disciple of Mestre Suassuna
- When Suassuna moved to São Paulo (seeking better life), Medicina remained in Bahia
- "At that time was not yet a mestre"
- Later "began forming disciples throughout Bahia"
- Mestre Lobão trained with "Mestres Antônio Rodrigues and Luiz Medicina"
- By Mestre Medicina's recommendation, Lobão trained with Suassuna in Cordão de Ouro

**Mestre Suassuna** (Generation 2):
- Trained with mestres from his region plus Mestre Bimba
- Co-founded Cordão de Ouro (CDO) with Mestre Brasília (September 1, 1967)
- Moved from Bahia to São Paulo
- Trained many prominent mestres including Medicina, Marcelo Caveirinha (Capoeira Mandinga founder), and others

**Mestre Tarzan** (Generation 4):

## USA Expansion - From Grupo Bantu to Beira-Mar Reunion

### Founder of USA Presence - Contra-Mestre Bundo

**Full Name**: Not documented
**Capoeira Name**: Bundo
**Current Title**: Contra-Mestre (possibly Mestre by now - documentation unclear)
**Location**: Jacksonville, Florida (USA headquarters)
**Role**: "United States representative for Beira-Mar Capoeira"

### Training Background (Brazil)

**1984**: Started training Capoeira
- **First Mestre**: Mestre Tarzan (establishes direct connection)
- **Also trained under** (while in Brazil):
  - Mestre Canhão
  - Mestre Gladson
  - Mestre Burguês
  - Mestre Paulo Gomes
  - Mestre Ananias

**1990**: Became Professor
- Under Mestre Caiçara and Contra-Mestre Lampião
- 6 years after starting training

**Contra-Mestre Title**: Granted by Mestre Ananias
- Received before moving to United States
- Indicates substantial training in Brazil before emigration

### Journey to USA and Group Evolution

**Step 1: Immigration and Independence** (Date unclear)
- Moved from Brazil to United States
- Settled in Jacksonville, Florida

**Step 2: Founded Grupo Bantu Capoeira**
- **Name "Bantu"**: Reference to Bantu peoples of Africa (cultural/historical significance)
- Founded independently in Jacksonville
- Built capoeira presence in Florida

**Step 3: Renamed to "Bantu Beira-Mar"**
- "While staying in contact with his first Mestre, Mestre Tarzan"
- "Decided to adopt the group name Bantu Beira Mar"
- **Dual name** shows:
  - "Bantu" = Bundo's contribution and founding
  - "Beira-Mar" = connection to Tarzan's organization
- Represents reconnection/reunion with master's organization

**Step 4: Merged with Beira-Mar**
- **Purpose**: "To establish a Beira-Mar Capoeira presence within the United States"
- Bundo became official US representative
- Full organizational integration
- Now operates as "Capoeira Beira-Mar – USA"

**This Evolution Shows**:
```
Grupo Bantu (independent USA group)
    ↓
Bantu Beira-Mar (dual identity, reconnection)
    ↓
Beira-Mar USA (full merger, official representation)
```

## Data Model Insights

### 1. Reunion/Merger Pattern - Independent → Reconnection → Integration

**Pattern**: Student founds independent group in diaspora, later reconnects and merges with master's organization

```typescript
organizational_evolution: {
  evolution_type: 'independent_founding_to_reunion_merger',

  phases: [
    {
      phase: 1,
      name: 'Grupo Bantu',
      status: 'independent_founding',
      founder: uuid,                      // Contra-Mestre Bundo
      location: 'Jacksonville, FL, USA',
      connection_to_master: 'maintained_contact_with_first_mestre',
      first_mestre: uuid,                 // Mestre Tarzan
    },
    {
      phase: 2,
      name: 'Bantu Beira-Mar',
      status: 'reconnection_dual_identity',
      demonstrates: 'both_founders_contribution_and_master_connection',
      dual_naming: {
        'Bantu': 'Bundos_founding_and_african_roots',
        'Beira-Mar': 'Tarzans_organization_connection'
      }
    },
    {
      phase: 3,
      name: 'Beira-Mar USA',
      status: 'full_merger_official_representation',
      bundo_role: 'US_representative_for_Tarzan',
      purpose: 'establish_beira_mar_presence_in_united_states',
      organizational_integration: 'complete'
    }
  ],

  significance: 'student_founded_independently_then_chose_to_merge_back'
}
```

**This differs from**:
- Blessed split (CB from Senzala): Stays independent
- Conflict split: Severs relationship
- **This is**: Independence → Maintained relationship → Voluntary reunion/merger

**Why reunion occurred** (speculation):
- Maintained strong relationship with Mestre Tarzan
- Wanted formal connection to master's lineage
- Organizational benefits of international structure
- Legitimization through official representation

### 2. US Representative Model - International Authority Delegation

**Pattern**: Master in origin country appoints representative in diaspora country

```typescript
international_representation: {
  model: 'designated_country_representative',

  structure: {
    master: {
      person_id: uuid,                    // Mestre Tarzan
      location: 'Brazil (Araçatuba, Campinas)',
      role: 'overall_organizational_leader',
      travels_to_usa: 'when_possible'
    },
    representative: {
      person_id: uuid,                    // Contra-Mestre Bundo
      location: 'USA (Jacksonville, FL)',
      title: 'United_States_representative',
      authority: 'day_to_day_usa_operations',
      relationship: 'reports_to_coordinates_with_mestre'
    }
  },

  differs_from: [
    'independent_chapter',                // Not autonomous
    'branch_manager',                     // More than just manager
    'franchise',                          // Not commercial license
  ],

  demonstrates: 'formal_international_authority_delegation'
}
```

**This shows**: Masters can appoint representatives in other countries while maintaining overall authority.

### 3. University Partnership Model - Academic Legitimacy

**Pattern**: Capoeira taught within university curriculum

```typescript
university_partnerships: {
  partnership_type: 'curriculum_integration',

  universities: [
    {
      name: 'Eastern Kentucky University (EKU)',
      department: 'Exercise & Sports Science',
      instructors: [
        uuid,                             // Professor Perna de Pau
        uuid                              // Instrutor Jaco (current)
      ],
      status: 'active',
      student_recruitment: 'university_students_can_enroll'
    },
    {
      name: 'University of North Florida (UNF)',
      instructor: uuid,                   // Capitão
      duration: '8_plus_years',
      status: 'active_or_recent'
    }
  ],

  benefits: [
    'academic_legitimacy',
    'student_recruitment_from_university_population',
    'professional_teaching_environment',
    'institutional_support',
    'steady_student_pipeline'
  ],

  demonstrates: 'capoeira_recognized_as_legitimate_university_offering'
}
```

**This reveals**: Universities in USA recognize capoeira as legitimate physical education/martial arts offering.

### 4. Multi-Mestre Training Background

**Pattern**: Student trains under multiple mestres before establishing position

```typescript
person_training: {
  person_id: uuid,                        // Contra-Mestre Bundo
  training_model: 'multi_mestre_brazilian_community',

  primary_lineage: {
    first_mestre: uuid,                   // Mestre Tarzan
    organization: 'Beira-Mar',
    relationship: 'maintained_throughout_career'
  },

  additional_training: [
    { mestre: 'Canhão' },
    { mestre: 'Gladson' },
    { mestre: 'Burguês' },
    { mestre: 'Paulo Gomes' },
    { mestre: 'Ananias' }
  ],

  graduations: [
    {
      title: 'Professor',
      year: 1990,
      awarded_by: ['Mestre Caiçara', 'Contra-Mestre Lampião']
    },
    {
      title: 'Contra-Mestre',
      awarded_by: 'Mestre Ananias',
      before: 'moving_to_usa'
    }
  ],

  pattern: 'primary_mestre_plus_community_training',
  demonstrates: 'brazilian_capoeira_community_cross_training_common'
}
```

**This shows**: Having "first mestre" doesn't mean exclusive training - community training is normal.

### 5. Mestre Medicina as Intermediary Generation

**Pattern**: Mestre Suassuna's student becomes lineage transmitter

```typescript
lineage_transmission: {
  legendary_founder: uuid,                // Mestre Bimba
  direct_students: [uuid],                // Mestre Suassuna (and others)

  intermediary_generation: {
    person: uuid,                         // Mestre Medicina
    role: 'lineage_transmitter',
    context: {
      when_suassuna_left: 'Bahia_to_Sao_Paulo',
      medicina_status: 'not_yet_mestre',
      later_role: 'began_forming_disciples_throughout_bahia'
    },
    significance: 'preserved_and_transmitted_line age_in_bahia_while_suassuna_in_sao_paulo'
  },

  fourth_generation: {
    person: uuid,                         // Mestre Tarzan
    sent_by: uuid,                        // Suassuna
    year: 1974,
    destination: 'Campinas',
    indication: 'by_suassuna',            // Suggests Suassuna still involved in sending students
    direct_training: 'under_medicina'
  }
}
```

**This reveals**:
- Intermediary generations critical for lineage preservation
- Medicina preserved Bahia lineage while Suassuna built São Paulo presence
- Suassuna maintained involvement (sent Tarzan to Campinas 1974)
- Multi-generational lineage transmission paths

### 6. Dual Headquarters - Origin Country + Diaspora

**Pattern**: Organization maintains headquarters in both origin and diaspora countries

```typescript
headquarters_model: {
  model: 'dual_headquarters_origin_and_diaspora',

  brazil_headquarters: {
    location: 'Araçatuba and Campinas, São Paulo',
    leader: uuid,                         // Mestre Tarzan
    role: 'origin_and_overall_leadership',
    established: '1974+',
    students: '200_plus'
  },

  usa_headquarters: {
    location: 'Jacksonville, FL',
    leader: uuid,                         // Contra-Mestre Bundo
    role: 'diaspora_operations',
    established: 'unknown_year',
    coordinates_with: 'brazil_headquarters'
  },

  relationship: 'coordinated_not_independent',
  master_travels_between: true,           // Tarzan visits USA when possible

  differs_from: [
    'single_headquarters',                // Most groups
    'independent_chapters',               // These are coordinated
    'franchise_model'                     // Not commercial relationship
  ]
}
```

**This shows**: International organizations can maintain dual headquarters with coordinated leadership.

### 7. "Sent by Master" Founding Pattern

**Pattern**: Master sends student to establish presence in new location

```typescript
founding_mechanism: {
  mechanism_type: 'sent_by_master_to_new_location',

  example: {
    master: uuid,                         // Mestre Suassuna
    student: uuid,                        // Mestre Tarzan
    year: 1974,
    from: 'Bahia_or_Sao_Paulo',
    to: 'Campinas, São Paulo',
    phrase: 'arrived_in_Campinas_by_indication_of_Mestre_Suassuna',
    interpretation: 'suassuna_sent_or_recommended_tarzan_to_establish_presence'
  },

  differs_from: [
    'student_moves_independently',        // Student's own initiative
    'student_sent_as_employee',           // Modern organizational sending
  ],

  traditional_pattern: 'master_expands_influence_by_sending_trusted_students'
}
```

**This reveals**: Traditional capoeira expansion through masters sending students to new locations.

## Notes for Database Implementation

**Unique characteristics requiring schema consideration**:

1. ✅ **Reunion/merger pattern** (independent → reconnection → full integration)
2. ✅ **Dual headquarters model** (Brazil origin + USA diaspora, coordinated)
3. ✅ **US representative formal designation** (authority delegation to other country)
4. ✅ **University curriculum integration** (EKU, UNF partnerships)
5. ✅ **Multi-mestre training background** (primary + 5+ additional mestres)
6. ✅ **Intermediary lineage generation** (Medicina between Suassuna and Tarzan)
7. ✅ **"Sent by master" founding** (Suassuna sent Tarzan to Campinas 1974)
8. ✅ **Name evolution preserving both identities** (Grupo Bantu → Bantu Beira-Mar → Beira-Mar)
9. ✅ **Generation 4 from legendary founder** (Bimba → Suassuna → Medicina → Tarzan)
10. ✅ **Three-country presence** (Brazil, USA, South Korea)
11. ✅ **Kentucky concentration** (3 of 5 USA locations in single state)
12. ✅ **Academic institutional partnerships** (capoeira in university curriculum)

**Relationship types to support**:
- `independent_founding_to_reunion`: Grupo Bantu → merged with Beira-Mar
- `designated_country_representative`: Bundo as US representative for Tarzan
- `sent_by_master_to_new_location`: Suassuna → Tarzan to Campinas (1974)
- `trained_under_multiple_mestres`: Bundo under 6+ mestres (Tarzan primary)
- `intermediary_lineage_transmitter`: Medicina between Suassuna and Tarzan
- `dual_headquarters_coordination`: Brazil HQ ↔ USA HQ
- `university_curriculum_partnership`: Beira-Mar ↔ EKU, UNF
- `master_visits_representative`: Tarzan visits USA when possible

**Group characteristics**:
- Founding context: "master_sent_student_to_establish_presence" (Brazil 1974)
- USA founding: "independent_then_voluntary_reunion_merger"
- Leadership model: "dual_headquarters_with_country_representative"
- Scale: "international_modest" (8+ locations, 3 countries)
- Headquarters: "dual_coordinated" (Brazil + USA)
- Style: "regional_bimba_lineage_through_suassuna"
- University presence: "curriculum_integrated_partnerships"
- Geographic focus: "kentucky_concentration_in_usa" (unusual)

**Person characteristics** (Mestre Tarzan):
- Generation from Bimba: 4
- Lineage: Bimba → Suassuna → Medicina → Tarzan
- Founding mechanism: "sent_by_master" (Suassuna's indication, 1974)
- Experience: 35+ years
- Students: 200+ (Brazil schools)
- International travel: Visits USA when possible

**Person characteristics** (Contra-Mestre Bundo):
- Training start: 1984
- Multi-mestre training: 6+ mestres
- Professor: 1990 (6 years training)
- Contra-Mestre: Before USA move
- Founding pattern: "independent_then_reunion"
- Current role: "US_representative"

**This case study reveals**:
- Students can found independent groups then voluntarily merge back with master's organization
- International representatives can be formally designated for other countries
- Dual headquarters (origin + diaspora) can function with coordination
- University partnerships provide academic legitimacy and student pipeline
- Multi-mestre training in Brazil is common even with "first mestre"
- Intermediary generations (Medicina) preserve lineage when legendary mestres move
- Masters send students to new locations to establish presence (traditional pattern)
- Name evolution can preserve both founder's contribution and master's tradition
- Generation 4 from legendary founder can lead significant international organizations
- Kentucky concentration (3 of 5 US locations) raises questions about expansion strategy

**Critical for data model**:
- Need to support reunion/merger organizational evolution (multi-phase)
- Dual headquarters with coordination (not independent chapters)
- Country representative designation (formal authority delegation)
- University partnership type (curriculum integration vs. club vs. outreach)
- Multi-mestre training tracking (primary + additional influences)
- "Sent by master" founding mechanism (distinct from independent migration)
- Name evolution preserving dual identity (Grupo Bantu → Bantu Beira-Mar)
- Intermediary lineage generation roles (transmitters between famous mestres)
