# Case Study: Capoeira Longe do Mar (Mexico)

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Founded**: May 1998 (Mexico City)
**Founders**: Rosalinda Pérez, Iñaki Garrido, Adolfo Flores (three co-founders)
**Current Leaders**: Mestre Cigano, Contra-Mestre Rosita, Contra-Mestre Adolfo Flores
**Location**: Mexico - Mexico City, Morelia, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, León, Tijuana, Salamanca, San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato
**Style**: Capoeira Contemporânea/Mixed ("Capoeira without labels")
**Scale**: National (9+ cities across Mexico, 300+ students)

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**Limited Scope**: This case study examines ONE Mexican capoeira group out of hundreds (possibly thousands) of Capoeira organizations worldwide.

**Not Representative**: Observations here reflect only Capoeira Longe do Mar's specific structure and history. Other groups may have completely different organizational models.

**Preliminary Research**: All insights are preliminary and based on publicly available information. Community verification is essential before drawing any general conclusions about Capoeira organizational patterns.

**Historical Significance**: This case study is critically important because:
1. **Split for stylistic freedom** - Founded by people wanting "capoeira without labels" (mixed style)
2. **First Mexican mestres** - Mestre Cigano and Contra-Mestre Rosita are first Mexicans to achieve these ranks
3. **Pioneering Mexico capoeira** - Split from Banda do Saci, Mexico's first registered capoeira group
4. **Annual national event** - 27 consecutive years of Encuentro Nacional (1998-2025)
5. **Proudly Mexican identity** - Explicitly "un grupo de capoeira orgullosamente mexicano"
6. **Dual-lineage recognition** - Graduated by both Regional (Acordeón) and Angola (Cabello) mestres

---

## Founding of Longe do Mar (May 1998)

### The Split - "Capoeira Without Labels"

**May 1998**: Longe do Mar founded
- **Context**: Banda do Saci had just shifted to exclusive Capoeira Angola
- **Reason**: "People interested in continuing to practice capoeira 'without labels' separated from Banda do Saci to start Longe do Mar"
- **Nature of split**: Ideological/stylistic - desire for mixed/open approach vs. pure Angola

**"Without Labels" Philosophy**:
- Not restricted to Angola only
- Not restricted to Regional only
- Open to all capoeira styles and approaches
- Mixed/Contemporary approach
- Comprehensive, non-competitive methodology
- "Artistic vision" emphasis

## Lineage - Dual Recognition (Regional and Angola)

### Training Background - Through Mariano Andrade

**Primary Training**: All three founders trained under **Mariano Andrade**
- Argentine pioneer who brought capoeira to Mexico (1992)
- Trained founders in mixed/open capoeira approach
- Founded Banda do Saci (which later went pure Angola)

**Mariano Andrade's Background**:
- Nationality: Argentine
- Brought capoeira from Argentina/Brazil to Mexico
- Mixed style approach (taught both Angola and Regional elements)
- Founded first registered capoeira group in Mexico

**Lineage Through Andrade**:
- Not clearly documented
- Andrade likely trained in Brazil or Argentina
- Brought mixed approach to Mexico
- Transmitted comprehensive capoeira knowledge

### Dual Graduation Recognition

**Regional Lineage - Through Mestre Acordeón**:

**Mestre Acordeón** (Ubirajara Guimarães Almeida):
- Born in Brazil
- Trained under **Mestre Bimba** (founder of Capoeira Regional)
- Teaching in California since 1970s
- One of most important figures spreading Regional internationally

**Lineage Chain**:
```
Mestre Bimba (1900-1974, founded Capoeira Regional)
    ↓
Mestre Acordeón (student of Bimba, California-based)
    ↓
Contra-Mestre Adolfo Flores (Longe do Mar director, graduated 2005)
```

**2005**: Adolfo Flores received Contra-Mestre from Acordeón
- Represents Regional tradition validation
- California-Mexico connection
- International Regional lineage

**Angola Recognition - Through Mestre Cabello**:

**Mestre Cabello**:
- Capoeira Angola mestre
- Directs OuroVerde cultural farm, Bahia, Brazil
- Directs Barracão d'Angola cultural center, Serra Grande, Bahia
- Representatives in 5 locations (Brazil, Mexico, USA)

**2008**: Mestre Cabello recognized Longe do Mar professor graduations
- Along with Mestre Acordeón
- **Dual recognition**: Both Angola AND Regional mestres validated graduations
- Demonstrates Longe do Mar's mixed/comprehensive approach accepted by both traditions

### Significance of Dual Recognition

**"Capoeira Without Labels" Validated**:
- NOT pure Angola (would only need Angola mestre recognition)
- NOT pure Regional (would only need Regional mestre recognition)
- **BOTH traditions recognize Longe do Mar's approach**
- Mixed/Contemporary style legitimized by both lineages

**This is rare**: Most groups have single lineage path
- Longe do Mar has **dual lineage validation**
- Shows comprehensive capoeira approach
- Bridges Angola-Regional divide

---

## Philosophy and Approach - "Capoeira para todos"

### Core Philosophy

## Data Model Insights

### 1. Ideological/Stylistic Split - "Without Labels"

**Pattern**: Group splits from parent to maintain mixed/open approach when parent restricts to single style

```typescript
organizational_split: {
  split_type: 'ideological_stylistic_mixed_vs_pure',
  parent_group: uuid,                     // Banda do Saci
  child_group: uuid,                      // Longe do Mar
  split_year: 1998,
  split_month: 'May',

  trigger: {
    event: 'parent_shifted_to_exclusive_angola',
    banda_do_saci_shift: '1998_exclusively_capoeira_angola',
    affiliated_with: 'ECAIG_angola_organization_1997',
  },

  ideological_difference: {
    parent_position: 'pure_angola_only',
    splitters_position: 'capoeira_without_labels',
    splitters_phrase: 'sin etiquetas',
    meaning: 'mixed_contemporary_all_styles_open_approach',
  },

  founders_background: 'all_three_were_banda_do_saci_founding_members',
  nature: 'amicable_ideological',          // No conflict documented, stylistic choice
  maintained_connection: false,            // Separate paths

  philosophy: 'freedom_to_practice_all_capoeira_styles_not_restricted_to_one'
}
```

**This differs from**:
- Blessed split (student maturity): CB from Senzala, ICAF from GCAP
- Conflict split (disagreement): Not documented in other case studies
- **This is**: Style restriction disagreement - parent went pure, child wanted mixed

### 2. Dual Lineage Recognition (Angola + Regional)

**Pattern**: Organization recognized/graduated by mestres from BOTH major traditions

```typescript
dual_lineage_recognition: {
  organization: uuid,                     // Longe do Mar
  style_approach: 'mixed_contemporary_without_labels',

  regional_lineage: {
    recognition_year: 2005,
    graduated_person: uuid,               // Adolfo Flores
    title_received: 'Contra-Mestre',
    awarded_by: uuid,                     // Mestre Acordeón
    lineage_chain: ['Mestre Bimba', 'Mestre Acordeón', 'Adolfo Flores'],
    tradition: 'Capoeira_Regional'
  },

  angola_lineage: {
    recognition_year: 2008,
    event: '10th_Encuentro_Nacional_first_professor_graduation_in_mexico',
    recognized_by: uuid,                  // Mestre Cabello
    also_recognized_by: uuid,             // Mestre Acordeón (dual ceremony)
    tradition: 'Capoeira_Angola'
  },

  significance: 'both_traditions_validate_mixed_contemporary_approach',
  demonstrates: 'bridges_angola_regional_divide',
  legitimacy: 'dual_lineage_acceptance'
}
```

**This reveals**: Mixed/Contemporary groups can receive validation from BOTH traditions simultaneously.

### 3. First National Mestres - Diaspora Achievement

**Pattern**: First practitioners from diaspora country achieve mestre ranks

```typescript
national_first_achievements: {
  country: 'Mexico',
  capoeira_arrived: 1992,
  first_group_founded: 1996,              // Banda do Saci
  longe_do_mar_founded: 1998,

  first_mexican_mestre: {
    person: uuid,                         // Mestre Cigano
    achievement: 'first_mexican_to_achieve_mestre_rank',
    year: unknown,                        // Not documented
    organization: 'Longe do Mar',
    significance: 'mexican_capoeirista_reaching_highest_rank'
  },

  first_mexican_female_contra_mestre: {
    person: uuid,                         // Contra-Mestre Rosita
    achievement: 'first_mexican_woman_to_achieve_contra_mestre_rank',
    year: unknown,
    organization: 'Longe do Mar',
    significance: 'womens_leadership_and_mexican_achievement'
  },

  timeline: {
    years_from_first_capoeira_to_first_mestre: '20_plus_years',
    demonstrates: 'diaspora_countries_can_develop_local_mestres'
  }
}
```

**This shows**: Capoeira in diaspora countries can mature to produce local mestres (not just Brazilian teachers).

### 4. Three Co-Founders from Parent Organization

**Pattern**: Multiple founding members of parent group leave together to found new group

```typescript
founding_pattern: {
  founding_type: 'multiple_founders_from_parent_organization',
  founders_count: 3,

  founders: [
    { name: 'Rosalinda Pérez', role_in_parent: 'founding_member' },
    { name: 'Iñaki Garrido', role_in_parent: 'founding_member' },
    { name: 'Adolfo Flores', role_in_parent: 'founding_member' }
  ],

  all_founders_shared: {
    teacher: uuid,                        // Mariano Andrade
    parent_organization: uuid,            // Banda do Saci
    parent_founding_role: 'founding_members',
    parent_duration: '1996-1998',         // 2 years
    left_together: true,
    founded_together: true
  },

  leadership_evolution: {
    initial: 'adolfo_flores_became_director',
    current: 'collaborative_among_mestres_and_contra_mestres'
  },

  demonstrates: 'coordinated_group_departure_from_parent_by_founding_members'
}
```

**Different from**: Single founder leaving, or random students leaving separately.

### 5. Annual National Event as Core Mission

**Pattern**: Organizing annual encounter as foundational organizational activity

```typescript
annual_event_mission: {
  event_name: 'Encuentro Nacional de Capoeira',
  organizing_group: uuid,                 // Longe do Mar
  founding_year: 1998,
  event_start_year: 1998,                 // Same year as founding!
  consecutive_years: 27,                  // 1998-2025, never missed

  significance: 'organizing_national_event_core_to_identity',

  evolution: {
    initial_purpose: 'build_mexican_capoeira_community',
    annual_tradition: true,
    international_guests: 'recognized_capoeira_personalities',
    milestone_events: [
      {
        year: 2008,
        encounter_number: 10,
        milestone: 'first_professor_graduation_in_mexico'
      },
      {
        year: 2025,
        encounter_number: 27,
        innovation: 'all_activities_free_for_first_time'
      }
    ]
  },

  scale: {
    expected_2025: '~1000_participants',
    participation: 'mexico_city_other_states_international',
    activities: ['workshops', 'rodas', 'classes', 'performances', 'culture']
  },

  demonstrates: 'event_organizing_as_organizational_mission_from_founding'
}
```

**This shows**: Some groups define themselves by events they organize, not just classes they teach.

### 6. "Proudly Mexican" Diaspora Identity

**Pattern**: Diaspora group explicitly claims national identity (not "Brazilian group in X country")

```typescript
diaspora_national_identity: {
  organization: uuid,                     // Longe do Mar
  origin_country: 'Brazil',               // Capoeira origin
  diaspora_country: 'Mexico',
  founded_by: 'mexican_practitioners',    // Trained by Argentine in Mexico

  explicit_identity: 'un_grupo_de_capoeira_orgullosamente_mexicano',
  translation: 'a_proudly_mexican_capoeira_group',

  demonstrates: {
    not_brazilian_group_in_mexico: true,
    mexican_ownership: true,
    mexican_cultural_adaptation: true,
    respect_for_brazilian_roots: true,
    local_identity_while_honoring_origin: true
  },

  first_mexican_mestres: {
    mestre_cigano: 'first_mexican_mestre',
    contra_mestre_rosita: 'first_mexican_woman_contra_mestre',
    significance: 'mexican_leadership_not_brazilian_expatriates'
  },

  cultural_integration: 'mexican_group_practicing_brazilian_art'
}
```

**This reveals**: Diaspora groups can develop distinct national identity while respecting art's origins.

### 7. Comprehensive Cultural Education Beyond Capoeira

**Pattern**: Teaching broader Afro-Brazilian culture, not just capoeira technique

```typescript
cultural_education_model: {
  organization: uuid,                     // Longe do Mar
  approach: 'comprehensive_afro_brazilian_culture',

  offerings_beyond_capoeira: [
    'portuguese_language',
    'maculelê',                           // Stick dance/martial art
    'samba',                              // Music/dance
    'batucada',                           // Percussion
    'afro_brazilian_dance',
  ],

  integrated_approach: {
    not_just: 'martial_technique',
    includes: [
      'music', 'songs', 'dance', 'history',
      'theater', 'struggle', 'language'
    ]
  },

  community_model: 'multidisciplinary_artists',
  members: ['musicians', 'dancers', 'actors', 'visual_artists', 'athletes'],

  philosophy: 'capoeira_as_powerful_means_of_expression',

  demonstrates: 'holistic_afro_brazilian_cultural_immersion_not_just_sport'
}
```

**This shows**: Some groups teach comprehensive cultural context, not isolated capoeira technique.

### 8. "Without Labels" Philosophy - Anti-Restriction

**Pattern**: Explicit rejection of style restrictions, embrace of openness

```typescript
philosophy_without_labels: {
  phrase: 'capoeira_sin_etiquetas',
  translation: 'capoeira_without_labels',

  means: {
    not_restricted_to: ['only_angola', 'only_regional'],
    open_to: ['angola', 'regional', 'contemporanea', 'all_approaches'],
    philosophy: 'comprehensive_inclusive_mixed'
  },

  contrasts_with: {
    parent_organization: 'banda_do_saci_exclusively_capoeira_angola',
    demonstrates: 'rejection_of_stylistic_purity_requirements'
  },

  values: {
    artistic_vision: true,
    non_competitive: true,
    comprehensive: true,
    safe_and_integral: true,
    accessible_to_all: true
  },

  motto: 'capoeira_para_todos',           // Capoeira for all

  demonstrates: 'explicit_mixed_style_as_founding_principle_and_identity'
}
```

**This reveals**: "Without labels" is ideological position, not just stylistic choice.

## Unknown / Unclear Aspects

**Questions requiring community verification**:

1. **Mariano Andrade's lineage**: Where/with whom did he train? Argentina? Brazil?

## Notes for Database Implementation

**Unique characteristics requiring schema consideration**:

1. ✅ **Ideological/stylistic split** (parent went pure, child wanted mixed)
2. ✅ **"Without labels" philosophy** (explicit anti-restriction stance)
3. ✅ **Dual lineage recognition** (both Angola AND Regional mestres validate)
4. ✅ **Three co-founders from parent org** (coordinated founding members departure)
5. ✅ **First national mestres** (Mexicans achieving highest ranks)
6. ✅ **Annual national event as core mission** (27 consecutive years)
7. ✅ **"Proudly Mexican" diaspora identity** (national ownership, not Brazilian expat group)
8. ✅ **Comprehensive cultural education** (Portuguese, maculelê, samba, beyond capoeira)
9. ✅ **Argentine pioneer bringing to Mexico** (not Brazilian, not Mexican - third nationality)
10. ✅ **Parent org affiliated with Angola group** (ECAIG connection triggered pure Angola shift)
11. ✅ **Multi-style validation in same ceremony** (2008 graduation recognized by both traditions)
12. ✅ **Free access mission** (2025 Encuentro all activities free)

**Relationship types to support**:
- `ideological_stylistic_split`: Longe do Mar ← Banda do Saci (mixed vs. pure Angola)
- `trained_under`: All founders ← Mariano Andrade
- `dual_lineage_graduation`: Adolfo Flores ← Acordeón (Regional) + Cabello (Angola) recognition
- `parent_org_founding_members`: Rosalinda, Iñaki, Adolfo were Banda do Saci founders
- `first_national_achievement`: Cigano (first Mexican mestre), Rosita (first Mexican woman CM)
- `annual_event_organizer`: Longe do Mar organizes Encuentro Nacional (27 years)
- `parent_affiliated_with`: Banda do Saci ← ECAIG (1997, triggered Angola shift)

**Group characteristics**:
- Founding context: "ideological_split_for_style_freedom"
- Philosophy: "capoeira_without_labels_mixed_approach"
- National identity: "proudly_mexican_diaspora_group"
- Style: "mixed_contemporary_anti_restriction"
- Scale: "national_mexico" (9+ cities, 300+ students)
- Core mission: "annual_national_event_organizing"
- Cultural approach: "comprehensive_afro_brazilian_education"
- Legal structure: "asociacion_civil_non_profit"

**Person characteristics** (Mestre Cigano):
- Achievement: "first_mexican_to_achieve_mestre_rank"
- Training location: "Mexico"
- Organization: "Longe do Mar"
- Significance: "diaspora_country_producing_local_mestre"

**Person characteristics** (Contra-Mestre Rosita):
- Achievement: "first_mexican_woman_contra_mestre"
- Gender: Female
- Leadership: "women's_leadership_in_capoeira"
- National significance: "Mexican achievement"

**This case study reveals**:
- Groups can split when parent restricts style (pure vs. mixed ideological divide)
- "Without labels" philosophy is explicit anti-restriction position
- Mixed/Contemporary groups can receive validation from BOTH Angola and Regional traditions
- Diaspora countries can mature to produce local mestres (not dependent on Brazilian teachers)
- Multiple founding members of parent org can leave together in coordinated departure
- Annual event organizing can be core mission (not just teaching classes)
- Diaspora groups can claim national identity ("proudly Mexican") while respecting origins
- Comprehensive cultural education (language, dance, music) beyond just martial technique
- Third nationality pioneers can introduce capoeira (Argentine bringing to Mexico)
- Parent orgs affiliating with pure-style groups can trigger splits by mixed-style members

**Critical for data model**:
- Need to support ideological/stylistic split type (different from maturity/geography splits)
- Dual lineage recognition (graduated/recognized by multiple tradition mestres)
- "First national achievement" milestone type (first mestre from diaspora country)
- Annual event organizing as organizational mission (not just ancillary activity)
- National diaspora identity (distinct from "Brazilian group in X country")
- "Without labels" / anti-restriction philosophy as explicit position
- Multi-founder coordinated departure from parent organization
- Cultural education breadth beyond capoeira (language, dance, music, etc.)
