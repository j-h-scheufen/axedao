## Name Significance: "Angola Dobrada"

### Musical/Technical Meaning

**"Dobrada"** (Portuguese): "doubled" or "folded"

**Toque de Angola Dobrada** (berimbau rhythm):
- Based on traditional Angola rhythm
- **Added feature**: One extra note on the medium area of the berimbau (just above the coin)
- Creates a "doubled" variation of the traditional Angola toque
- Also called **"Contemporânea"** in some contexts
- Used for slower game, closer to Capoeira Angola traditional pace

**Context in Capoeira Regional**:
- Angola Dobrada is one of the most played toques in Regional, alongside:
  - São Bento Pequeno
  - São Bento Grande
  - São Angola

### Implication for Group Identity

**By naming the organization "Angola Dobrada"**:
- References a specific musical/rhythmic tradition
- Emphasizes connection to both Angola tradition AND its evolution
- Suggests innovation within tradition (doubled/folded variation)
- Distinguishes from pure "Angola" groups while maintaining Angola identity

## Organizational Structure

### Leadership Model

**Co-founders model** (1992-present):

- 1992-2004: Co-founder but not yet Mestre
- 2004-present: Co-founder and Mestre
- Titled by his own co-founder (Rogério)

### Organizational Model

- Central coordination by founding mestres
- Shared identity and mission

**Geographic structure**:
- **Europe** (primary base): Germany (6+ locations), Italy (2 locations)
- **Brazil** (origin of founders): 3 locations
- Founded in Europe, expanded back to Brazil (reverse of typical pattern)

**Decentralized web presence**: Each núcleo maintains own website/blog rather than single centralized site, similar to other nucleus network organizations (Filhos de Angola, Angoleiros do Sertão, Ngoma).

---

## Data Model Insights

### 1. Founded in Europe, Not Brazil

**Unusual pattern**:
- Most Capoeira organizations: Founded in Brazil → expanded to Europe
- ACAD: Founded in Germany (1992) → expanded to Brazil

**Why this happened**:
1. Mestre Rogério moved to Germany in 1990 (invited by Índio)
2. Established ACAD in Kassel in 1992
3. Later expanded back to Brazil (Belo Horizonte, where Rogério had founded 1st Angola school)

**Implication for data model**:
```typescript
group_founding: {
  founding_location: string,           // "Kassel, Germany"
  founding_country: string,            // "Germany" (not founder's origin country)
  founders_origin_country: string,     // "Brazil"
  founding_context: 'diaspora_founding' | 'origin_founding',
  reverse_expansion: boolean           // true (founded abroad, expanded to origin country)
}
```

### 2. Co-Founder Titled Later

**Mestre Índio pattern**:
- 1992: Co-founded ACAD (not yet Mestre)
- 2004: Titled Mestre by co-founder (Rogério)
- 12-year gap between founding and titling

**Questions this raises**:
- What was Índio's title in 1992? (Contramestre? Professor? Advanced student?)
- Did he have formal authority to co-found without Mestre title?
- Is this common in Angola groups?

**Schema consideration**:
```typescript
person_group_relationships: {
  person_id: uuid,
  group_id: uuid,
  relationship_type: 'co_founder',
  started_at: Date,                    // 1992
  rank_at_start: string,               // "Contramestre" or "Professor" (unknown)
  titled_mestre_at?: Date,             // 2004
  titled_by?: uuid                     // Mestre Rogério
}
```

### 3. Dual Lineage Recognition

**Mestre Rogério titled by TWO organizations**:
- GCAP (Mestre Moraes)
- FICA (Mestre Cobra Mansa)
- Both in 1989

**This is different from**:
- Mestre Laércio (GCFA): Titled by Moraes + Cobra Mansa separately
- Most mestres: Single lineage titling

**Schema consideration**:
```typescript
person_title_events: {
  person_id: uuid,
  title: 'mestre',
  titled_by: uuid[],                   // [Moraes, Cobra Mansa]
  organizations: uuid[],               // [GCAP, FICA]
  date: Date,                          // 1989
  is_dual_recognition: boolean         // true
}
```

### 4. Name Based on Musical Rhythm

**"Angola Dobrada"**:
- Not a geographic name (unlike "Senzala", "Muzenza", "Axé")
- Not a founder's name (unlike "Grupo Mestre X")
- Based on **berimbau rhythm/toque**
- Technical/musical reference

**Other musical-based names encountered**:
- None in case studies so far

**Field consideration**:
```typescript
group_name_type: 'geographic' | 'founder_name' | 'musical_rhythm' | 'cultural_concept' | 'political_statement' | 'other'

group_name_significance: string       // "Refers to Angola rhythm variation with one extra note"
```

### 5. Three Annual International Meetings

**Pattern**: Rotating international events across 3 countries
- May: Germany
- July/Sept: Italy
- November: Brazil

**Different from**:
- Single annual batizado (most groups)
- Regional events only
- No regular international gatherings

**Organizational characteristic**:
```typescript
annual_events: [{
  event_type: 'international_meeting',
  frequency: 'annual',
  locations: ['Freiburg, Germany', 'Cesena, Italy', 'Belo Horizonte, Brazil'],
  months: ['May', 'July/September', 'November'],
  cross_border: boolean                // true
}]
```

### 6. Casa Dobrada Project

**Building academia with residence**:
- Not just training space
- Includes living quarters
- Fundraising/community support model

**Similar to**:
- Casa Ngoma (Rio) - cultural center with community programs
- ABADÁ centers in some locations

**Schema consideration**:
```typescript
group_facilities: {
  group_id: uuid,
  facility_type: 'academia_with_residence' | 'cultural_center' | 'training_space_only',
  location: string,
  status: 'planning' | 'under_construction' | 'fundraising' | 'operational',
  has_residence: boolean,
  community_functions: string[]
}
```

### 7. Organizational Model: Nucleus Network

**Similar to**:
- Filhos de Angola (GCFA)
- Angoleiros do Sertão
- Ngoma

**Characteristics**:
- Semi-autonomous núcleos
- Local instructors (Mestres, Contra-mestres)
- Shared identity and mission
- Coordinated by founders
- No apparent fees/licensing (unlike CDO)
- Decentralized web presence

**Classification**:
```typescript
organizational_model: 'nucleus_network'

nucleus_characteristics: {
  autonomy_level: 'medium',            // Coordinated but autonomous
  central_coordination: boolean,       // true (Rogério travels, teaches)
  fee_structure: 'none_apparent' | 'licensing' | 'membership',
  approval_required: boolean           // Unknown
}
```

### 8. Early European Angola Presence

**Timeline context**:
- 1992: ACAD founded in Kassel
- 1997: Academia Jangada (Mestre Rosalvo, GCFA) in Berlin
- 1997: GCFA Sverige (Mestre Roberval) in Stockholm

**ACAD is one of the earliest Angola-specific organizations founded in Europe**.

**Implication**: Important for understanding Angola diaspora history and expansion patterns.

## Unknown / Unclear Aspects

**Questions requiring further research**:

1. What was Mestre Índio's rank/title when he co-founded ACAD in 1992? (Contramestre? Professor?)
2. Did Índio train under Rogério from 1990-2004, or did he have prior capoeira training?
3. Current location/activity base of Mestre Índio? (Germany or Brazil?)
4. How many total núcleos does ACAD have? (11 confirmed, but sources say "various")
5. Are there ACAD locations in other countries not documented? (Spain mentioned via Contramestre Bruno in Barcelona)
6. What is the governance structure? (Joint decision-making? Rogério primary? Regional autonomy?)
7. Do núcleos pay fees/dues to central organization, or fully autonomous?
8. How are new núcleos authorized/approved?
9. What is the relationship between núcleos - collaborative network or independent?
10. Total estimated membership across all ACAD núcleos?
11. Are there other students of Mestre Rogério who founded groups outside ACAD?
12. Casa Dobrada project status: Is it completed or still fundraising?
13. Specific Instagram accounts for ACAD núcleos? (Only @acadbh found for Belo Horizonte)

## Research Methodology Notes

### Guide Effectiveness

**Followed guide phases successfully**:
- Phase 1.1: Basic web searches (parallel) ✅
- Phase 1.3: Name disambiguation check ✅ (no conflicts found)
- Phase 2: Founder & lineage research ✅
- Phase 3: Group evolution & history ✅
- Phase 5: Geographic presence ✅
- Phase 6: Social media & digital presence ✅ (partial)
- Phase 8: Cultural characteristics ✅
- Phase 9: Data model pattern identification ✅

**No new guide improvements needed**: All 4 improvements from Filhos de Angola study were applicable and helpful.

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Limited English sources**: Many sources in German, Portuguese, Italian - WebFetch worked but some nuance may be lost
2. **Web search downtime**: Search tool had intermittent issues during research
3. **Sparse instructor information**: Most núcleos don't list instructors publicly on websites
4. **Mestre Índio details**: Very limited biographical information available
5. **Social media**: Found only one Facebook account (@acadbh), likely more exist but not discoverable

### Data Quality

**High confidence**:
- Founding date, location, founders ✅
- Mestre Rogério biography and lineage ✅
- Geographic locations (11 confirmed) ✅
- Name significance ✅
- Annual international meetings ✅

**Medium confidence**:
- Instructor details (only found 7 out of 11+ locations)
- Mestre Índio biography (sparse)
- Total number of núcleos
- Social media presence (likely incomplete)

**Low confidence**:
- Governance structure
- Fee/licensing model
- Approval process for new núcleos
- Mestre Índio's current base/activities

## Notes for Database Implementation

**Unique characteristics requiring schema consideration**:
1. ✅ Founded in diaspora (Europe), not origin country (Brazil)
2. ✅ Reverse expansion (Europe → Brazil, not typical Brazil → Europe)
3. ✅ Co-founder titled 12 years after founding
4. ✅ Dual lineage recognition (GCAP + FICA both titled Rogério)
5. ✅ Name based on musical rhythm/toque (not geographic or founder name)
6. ✅ Three annual international meetings (rotating locations)
7. ✅ Academia with residence project (Casa Dobrada)
8. ✅ Early European Angola presence (1992, one of first)

**Relationship types to support**:
- `co_founder_pre_title`: Co-founder who wasn't Mestre at founding
- `titled_by_co_founder`: Titled by fellow co-founder
- `dual_lineage_titling`: Titled by multiple organizations simultaneously
- `trained_under_multiple`: Rogério trained by both GCAP and FICA lineages
- `coordinates_network`: Rogério coordinates ACAD international network
- `nucleus_instructor`: Local instructors at each núcleo

**Group characteristics**:
- Founding context: "Diaspora founding" (Europe, not Brazil)
- Reverse expansion: true (founded abroad → expanded to origin)
- Legal structure: "e.V. (Germany), Associação (Brazil)"
- Style: "Angola (traditional)"
- Name type: "Musical rhythm"
- Name significance: "Dobrada = doubled Angola berimbau toque"
- Organizational model: "Nucleus network"
- Scale: 11+ locations, 3 countries
- Annual events: 3 international meetings (May/July-Sept/Nov)

**This case study reveals**:
- Capoeira organizations can be founded in diaspora and expand back to origin country
- Co-founders may not hold Mestre title at founding (organizational vs. technical authority)
- Dual lineage recognition from multiple major organizations is possible
- Musical/technical terms can serve as group names (not just geographic/personal names)
- Early European Angola presence (1992) predates many other groups' international expansion
- International meeting rotation creates cross-border community cohesion
