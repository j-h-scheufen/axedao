## 1. Pioneer Period: Mestre Osvaldo & Mestre Sabú (Late 1960s)

Before Grupo Candeias existed, two pioneer mestres established capoeira's presence in Goiânia, Goiás during the late 1960s:

### Mestre Sabú
- Conducted open rodas at Praça Cívica and Feira Hippie in Goiânia
- Promoted capoeira publicly in central Goiânia locations
- Made and sold capoeira instruments
- Helped plant the first seeds of capoeira culture in Goiás

### Mestre Osvaldo
- Taught classes at:
  - Jóquei Clube
  - Colégio Carlos Chagas
  - An academia in downtown Goiânia
- Made a historic contribution by bringing **Mestre Bimba himself** to Goiânia for the first graduation ceremony of his students
- This was a landmark moment for capoeira in Goiás, connecting the region directly to the legendary founder of Capoeira Regional

### Historical Significance

The group published a book titled **"A História da Capoeira de Goiás Contada Por Seus Pioneiros (Mestre Osvaldo E Mestre Sabú)"** (The History of Capoeira in Goiás Told By Its Pioneers), documenting the foundational period and honoring these early figures.

---

## 2. Founding & Early History (1975-1977)

### 1975: The SESC Negotiations

The embryonic origins of what would become Grupo Candeias began in 1975 when **Carlos Antônio (nicknamed "Carlinhos Chuchu")**, a Physical Education student, negotiated with **SESC Universitário** (Social Service of Commerce, University Sector) to establish a formal capoeira training space.

**The arrangement:**
- Carlinhos could teach capoeira at SESC facilities
- SESC members trained as part of membership benefits
- Non-members ("Outros") could pay Carlinhos directly for classes
- This created sustainable funding while providing community access

This became the **Grupo de Capoeira do SESC** (SESC Capoeira Group).

### 1977: Formal Founding as Anglo-Regional

In 1977, the group was formally established with the name **Grupo de Capoeira Anglo-Regional**.

**Name significance:**
- "Anglo" - unknown origin (possibly reference to international/English connection?)
- "Regional" - indicating the Capoeira Regional style from Mestre Bimba's lineage

**First instructor:** Carlos Antônio "Carlinhos Chuchu"

---

## 3. Leadership Succession & Name Evolution

### Leadership Timeline

1. **Carlinhos Chuchu (Carlos Antônio)** - 1975-1977
   - Founded the SESC program
   - Established the Anglo-Regional name
   - Student of Formiga (son of Mestre Bimba)

2. **Mestre Passarinho** - 1978
   - Assumed leadership in 1978
   - Renamed the group to **Grupo São Bento Pequeno**
   - "São Bento Pequeno" is a traditional capoeira rhythm, connecting to Angola traditions

3. **Mestre Suíno (Elto Pereira de Brito)** - 1981 to present
   - First mestre trained/graduated by the group itself
   - Assumed leadership at SESC in 1981
   - Initially returned to the "Anglo-Regional" name
   - Primary architect of the group's expansion and systematization
   - Current president of Associação de Capoeira Candeias

### Name Evolution: Three Phases

**Phase 1: Anglo-Regional (1977-1978)**
- Original formal name
- Regional style emphasis

**Phase 2: São Bento Pequeno (1978-1991)**
- Named after traditional capoeira rhythm
- Used during early expansion period

**Phase 3: Candeias (1991-present)**
- **When:** Adopted in 1991
- **How:** Selected through internal competitive process (multiple names proposed, Candeias chosen)
- **Why:** By mid-1980s, graduates had created competing groups with similar names; unification was needed
- **Significance:** "Candeias" means "candles" or "oil lamps" in Portuguese, symbolizing light/illumination
- **Result:** All branches unified under single name with shared philosophy, curriculum, and standards

The 1991 unification established:
- Shared philosophical principles
- Standardized curriculum
- Unified graduation system
- Common techniques and nomenclature
- Standardized uniforms

## 14. Key Takeaway

**Grupo Candeias de Capoeira represents a "regional systematization model" - a Brazilian group primarily centered in the Centro-Oeste region (Goiás) that systematized Mestre Bimba's Regional style through competitive excellence, pedagogical standardization, and headquarters-centric expansion.**

### What Makes This Group Unique

1. **Regional representation:** One of the few well-documented groups from Brazil's Centro-Oeste region (Goiás), filling a geographic gap in our case studies

2. **Pioneer recognition:** Explicitly honors the "pre-founding" pioneer period (Mestre Osvaldo and Mestre Sabú in late 1960s) through published book, demonstrating awareness of historical roots

3. **Biological lineage:** Direct connection to Mestre Bimba through his son Formiga (not just student lineage, but biological descent)

4. **Unification through naming:** Solved fragmentation problem in 1991 by consolidating competing graduate-led groups under single "Candeias" brand with standardized curriculum and philosophy

5. **Competitive legitimacy:** Six consecutive national championships (JEBS 1983-1988) established credibility and drove expansion

6. **Headquarters-centric international network:** Unlike ABADÁ (decentralized legal entities) or Ngoma (autonomous continuation), Candeias maintains Goiânia as symbolic and operational center even with 17-country presence

7. **Comprehensive systematization:** Six operational areas (historical-cultural, technical, musical, philosophical, pedagogical, administrative) demonstrate institutional maturity

### Data Model Significance

This case study reveals patterns not yet captured in our schema:
- **Pioneer period preceding formal founding** (cultural foundation vs. organizational founding)
- **Unification through name change** (consolidation after fragmentation)
- **Biological son lineage** (Formiga as Mestre Bimba's son, not just student)
- **Competitive success driving expansion** (championships creating legitimacy and growth)
- **Regional systematization model** (primarily Brazilian/regional with some international reach, distinct from mega-networks like ABADÁ or CDO)

### Comparison: Candeias vs. Other Organizational Models

| Dimension | Grupo Candeias | ABADÁ | Ngoma | CDO |
|-----------|----------------|-------|-------|-----|
| **Headquarters role** | Central (GYN emphasis) | Decentralized legal entities | Autonomous continuation | Central (trademark control) |
| **Legitimacy source** | Competitive excellence + Bimba lineage | Camisa's prestige + scale | Marrom's lineage + philosophy | Suassuna's prestige + systematization |
| **Expansion driver** | Championships + systematization | Global brand + curriculum | Student autonomy + loyalty | Certification + licensing |
| **International scale** | 17 countries (moderate) | 60+ countries (massive) | ~10 countries (limited) | ~30 countries (large) |
| **Brazilian focus** | 13 states (strong) | National presence | Limited | São Paulo-based |
| **Geographic identity** | Goiás/Centro-Oeste | Rio de Janeiro | Rio de Janeiro | São Paulo |

**For the database:** Grupo Candeias fills the "regional powerhouse" category - groups with strong regional identity, national presence, and moderate international reach, distinct from both mega-networks (ABADÁ, CDO, Muzenza) and purely local/autonomous groups (Ngoma branches, Filhos de Zumbi).
