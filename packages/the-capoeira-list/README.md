# The Capoeira List

This package hosts files originally received from "The Capoeira List" project (http://home.znet.com/capoeira_list/) which contain a manually collected and curated list of capoeira groups across the globe, including publicly available information about locations, group representatives, and contacts.

This package adds (python) scripts for extracting, cleaning, and processing these files to derive structured data suitable for future use cases.
